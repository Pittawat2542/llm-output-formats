```yaml
game:
  description: quest description  
  id: id
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
    - description: task description
      location: task location
      order: task order
      objective: task objective
    title: quest title
```

The above command only outputs the desired YAML.
