Here is an example of the quest information:

```json
{
    "game": {
        "id": "quest ID here",
        "title": "quest title here",
        "objective": "quest objective here",
        "description": "quest description here",
        "reward": "quest reward here",
        "quest_giver": "quest giver here",
        "tasks": [{
            "order": "task order here",
            "objective": "task objective here",
            "description": "task description here",
            "location": "task location here"
        }]
    }
}
```

Your quest information has the following JSON format:
- A JSON object with key "game."
- A JSON object inside the "game." object with the keys "id", "title", "objective", "description", "reward", "quest_giver", and tasks."
- An array whose elements are JSON objects with the previous keys except for "id", which is a string.
- JSON objects inside the "tasks." array that have the keys "order", "objective", "description", and "location."
