Quest information.  You can start by creating a new game if you are a first time quest giver, which will allow you to send your quest to your quest givers.  After creating your initial game, you can begin to send quests, and it's a simple two step process.  The first step is to provide them with an ID that will help you identify the quests that you send them, as well as what the corresponding quest is called.  This ID should be unique to each quest you send to them.  Next, you can start to provide them with the information for the quest.  When you click "start sending", your quest will also become available to anyone who has already approved your game.  If you'd like to add your own quest, you can click on "Create New Game", and it will send you to a new window to complete some information.
