You can customize this template to match your specific quest structure. Inside `<game>`, all the child tags should have a `id`, `title`, and `objective` tag, which correspond to the original quest information. `<objective>` tag is used for the primary objective, while `<description>` is used for the secondary description. You can also add `<location>` and `<reward>` tags for additional information. To generate XML output, replace `<` and `>` with `<` and `>`.
