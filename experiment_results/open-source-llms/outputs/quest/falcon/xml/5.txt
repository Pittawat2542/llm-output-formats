Output format
```
```
<XML output
```

The output returned will be in XML format, with each quest object enclosed in a container with the appropriate tags. The tasks object in the Markdown code block is represented with the tag name `task` and is enclosed in a separate container with a `<tasks>` tag. Inside this container, the tasks array of each game is represented with the tag name `task` again, and each task element is defined with the tag name `<task>`. Additionally, each task location can be encapsulated with a `<location>` tag.
