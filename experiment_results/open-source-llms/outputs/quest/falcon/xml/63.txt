```markdown
# Enter quest information here. The XML will be generated using `xml` object in your language.
```xml
<objective lang="en">Enter your quest objective here</objective>
<description lang="en">Enter your quest description here</description>
<reward>Enter your quest reward here</reward>
<quest-giver>Enter your quest giver name</quest-giver>
<tasks lang="en">
    <task order="1">
        <objective lang="en">Enter your desired task objective here</objective>
        <description>Enter your desired task description here</description>
    </task>
</tasks>
```

This XML code contains the quest information, including the quest type, quest objective, quest description, task reward, quest giver, order of tasks, and task objective. When the XML is executed using XSLT or any other language, it generates the Markdown code block for that specific quest.
