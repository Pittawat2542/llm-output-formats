// Usage in HTML
<!-- Import the Quest Markdown code in HTML -->
<pre><code>// Find a way to replace the `class="reward"` tags
with "class=reward" in the Markdown code.
// This replaces `class="reward"` with "class="reward" >
// and removes the unnecessary newline at the end.
// For a working example, try using this code in the Markdown header.
// Add the class="reward" class to the quest giver to make
// them give quests that have a reward.
// Change the type of reward to whatever is appropriate for your game.
// For example, if your game is about completing quests that
// unlock superpowers for your city dwellers, you might
// use the class="superpower-reward".
</code></pre>

The code block is in Python, which is a coding language used to generate HTML content. The original text is in Markdown format and can be translated into HTML format. The ```xml``` block is wrapped in parentheses and is a shorthand for XML. Within the ```xml``` block are two tags corresponding to the Markdown format: ```<game>``` and ```<objective>```. Both tags replace their respective Markdown tags. Within the ```<code>game>``` tag, the information in the Markdown format is enclosed in a ```<code>&lt;game>&lt;/game>``` tag. Within the ```<objective>``` tag is the quest description, which can be found in the Markdown format. Within the ```<tasks>``` tag are their respective Markdown tags with the task order. Within each task's ```<task>``` tag are the necessary information from Markdown such as the task objective and location. You can replace it with the corresponding XML tag.
