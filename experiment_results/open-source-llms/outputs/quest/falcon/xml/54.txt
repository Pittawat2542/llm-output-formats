<p>Return only the XML in the `Markdown` code block if you have a specific task type, which you can check for by using the `Markdown` code block provided.</p>

```
@quests

?objective? (add this line to include the objective)
```

- `quests@name0:name1:name2` should return `<name1>`.
- `quests@name:objective:order` should return `<name,objective,order>`.

```
?:objective?:description:-?@id:=0
