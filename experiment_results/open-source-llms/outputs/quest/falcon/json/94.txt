# JSON output in Markdown code blocks 
Here's the quest output in JSON format. 
You have to make the quest title, objective, description, location, and reward all inside the game object. 
The reward is an array of task objects, inside the tasks object.
To get the output in JSON format, we'll use a template and replace each field in the query with its output in JSON. 

```
{{- templates/json.md "| replace "quest title" | replace "objective" }}
{{-.quest.description | replace "location" | replace "reward" | replace "quest giver" | replace. }}
```
