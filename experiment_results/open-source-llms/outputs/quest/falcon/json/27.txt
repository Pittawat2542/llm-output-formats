In addition to the `game` key, each child key can be replaced with the corresponding property for each task.

The `id` key can be modified to the ID of a specific task. Also, change the `objective` key to the quest objective (e.g. `"quest_giver" -> "quest giver").

The `objective` key can be replaced by the ID of an objective for each child key.

The `location` key can be replaced by the location of each child task.

A single task with multiple child tasks can also be created by wrapping it in an array and adding the `tasks` and `objective` keys.

```markdown
{
    // Game information and tasks
    "game": {
        "id": "game-details",
        "title": "Game details",
        "objective": "#quest-objective",
        "description": "This is the description of the game",
        "reward": "Quest reward",
        "quest_giver": "task-giver"
    }
}
```

In this example, the `game.location` key has an array of child tasks that each have their own individual `tasks` object and `objective` properties.
