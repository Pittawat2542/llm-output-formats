# Input format 
You can use Gherkit to generate JSON using Markdown. Just write JSON curly braces in the Gherkit editor, enclosing the keys and their respective values with no spaces.
The keys must be enclosed in quotes in the quest information, and the corresponding values must be inside double curly braces. 

Only the keys inside the `quest` object will be included in the JSON output when using this code snippet.
