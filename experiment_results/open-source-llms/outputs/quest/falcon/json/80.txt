<strong>Quiet Play</strong>
The `Quiet Play` quest is located on the second floor of The Black Tower. `Quiet Play` is only obtainable by using the secret key which can be learned from the `Black Tower Grotto Golem`. 
To complete it, you must navigate up to the second floor of The Black Tower using the secret lift and then proceed to the top. Once at the top in the Black Tower Courtyard, you will meet a man of the castle named "The Quiet Play". He will ask that you find a quiet area in the castle for the quiet play, there is no way for you to enter the Black Tower, so you'll need to search around the castle until you find an alternative. Once there, use the key you received from the `Grotto Golem` to unlock the door leading inside the Black Tower. Inside, you will meet a man named "Golemnir" who is the keeper of the Black Tower's secrets. He will tell you tales of the tower's past and of the quest's challenge. He also tells you about a secret lift leading up to The Black Tower. The lift requires a small bell to use which is near the Black Tower's courtyard. Once atop the roof, you will find a door that requires your `quest_giver` key in order to open it. If you have it, enter it and you'll be transported to the top in the quest. There is also a hidden quest at the top, called "Quiet Play" which requires you to kill 3 golems. Once all golems are dead, you can return back to The Black Tower and complete the quest.
