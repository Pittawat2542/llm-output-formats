You can parse the Markdown code block and return the necessary fields only.
For example, if the Markdown code block contains the following:

```
| Quest title |
|-------------|
| Test Quest |
| Reward: Gold |
| Difficulty: Medium |
| Reward: Xlien |
| Completion Date: Saturday, 1st of June |
```

The output in JSON format would look like:

```json
{
    "game": {
        "id": "Test Quest",
        "title": "Test Quest",
        "objective": "Quest Objective",
        "description": "Description",
        "reward": "Reward Name",
        "giver": "Quest Giver",
        "tasks": [{
            "order": "Task Order",
            "objective": "Task Objective",
            "description": "Task Description",
            "location": "Task Location"
        }]
    }
}
