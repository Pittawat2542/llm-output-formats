[Quest GIVER] – It seems you have reached the edge of the world, and I am here to help you navigate a treacherous quest. 
The sky is dark with storms, and the wind is howling. A journey across the world awaits you, and I am here to guide you through unknown lands, in search of a legendary artifact.

Before you embark on this wild adventure, I would advise you to prepare yourself. Pack warm clothing, bring a sturdy horse, and gather necessary supplies such as food and water.

Remember to follow the quest path, and beware of hidden monsters. It’s important to get ready for the challenges ahead, but also keep your wits about you in the face of danger. Keep a brave heart and you will soon accomplish great feats. 

May the power of your faith guide you on a triumphant quest, and may you come back with a story of triumph to tell.

Good luck!
