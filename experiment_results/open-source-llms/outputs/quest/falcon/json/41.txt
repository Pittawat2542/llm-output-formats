In the `JSON.stringify()` method, add `null` values to make the JSON more readable and compact. In the `quest_giver` field, replace `quest giver` with the name of the person who gives you the quest. In the `description` field, use single quotes to enclose text instead of double quotes. The `location` field should have only one opening bracket (`[]`), not two.

In-game, this information can be obtained by using the `GetQuests()` method and passing in the `game.id` parameter. In JavaScript applications, you can use `JSON.stringify(game.game)` to convert this JSON to a string and then parse it to an object using `JSON.parse()`.
