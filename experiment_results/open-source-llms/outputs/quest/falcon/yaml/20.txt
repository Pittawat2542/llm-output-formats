If your Markdown code contains YAML blocks, they are output in YAML format, and the YAML is surrounded with four spaces. If the YAML exists in a span, then it will be wrapped with `y`:

- `y title` sets title as `title`
- `q description` sets description of quest as `description`
- `r giver` sets quest giver as `giver`
