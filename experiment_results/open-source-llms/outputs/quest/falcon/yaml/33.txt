```
A Markdown code block that uses a YAML syntax to define the quest information. The `#` is used to separate Markdown and YAML. The quest information consists of four sections: game information (title), quest information (text), and tasks (quest steps). Each of the quest information sections should be wrapped in tags to indicate that they are part of the quest information. The YAML is generated automatically by the markdown syntax.
