YAML is a layout/syntax checker. It can be used to define and generate documentation Markdown. In this case, it defines the YAML syntax and key/value pairs for the quest object.

Each line inside the `task` block (if needed) should define a task that will be completed by the player. In turn, each `location` and `objective` should define the where and what the quest is about.

The `title` key is optional. The documentation can also include a title for the quest.
