<markdown-code-block>
# Output format
```

In Markdown, we can use backticks to surround the text inside the `()` block, but to render the YAML we need to use triple quotes. We can use triple quotes to expand the YAML in the Markdown code block and get a well-formatted output in YAML format. Here's an example:

```bash
game:
  description: "quest description"
  id: "1-12"
  objective: "quest objective"
  quest_giver:![](https://example.com/people/1-12)"
  reward: "quest reward"
  tasks:
  - description: task description
    location: https://example.com/location
    objective: task objective
    order: task order
  - description: task description
    location: task location
    objective: task objective
    order: task order
  title: quest title
```

Here's how the YAML output in YAML format would look:

```yaml
game:
  description: quest description
  id: 1-12
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver:
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
    - location: https://example.com/location
      objective: task objective
      order: task order
    - location: task location
      objective: task objective
      order: task order
