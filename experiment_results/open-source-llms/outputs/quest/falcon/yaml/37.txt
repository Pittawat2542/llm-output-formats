```yaml
output:
  markdown:
    type: markdown
    options:
      renderer:
        - render_yaml:
            - input:
                file: quest_info.yml
```

In the Markdown code block, replace `quest_giver`, `reward`, and `tasks` with their own respective placeholder values, and provide a YAML-compatible format for the quest_info.yml file to render into the Markdown.
