In the above YAML code block, the `tasks` key is an ordered list of task descriptions. Each task description is a separate key within the `tasks` mapping. To generate this query in a Markdown code block, it is recommended to include the `YAML.inline` syntax to display the YAML code as inline code. Also, ensure to specify the output format as YAML format which uses the `YAML.map` method to group key-value pairs and converts them to task and location names. The result will be shown in a table with the necessary key-value pairs.
