## Notes

### What is YAML?
YAML is a human-friendly data serialization language. It is an acronym for "YAML Ain't Markup Language." YAML is a data serialization language that is easy to read, write, and parse.

### What is a YAML file?
A YAML file is a text file that contains data that can be read by a computer. YAML files are often used to store configuration information for software applications.

### What is the difference between YAML and JSON?
YAML and JSON are both data serialization languages, but they have some key differences. YAML is human-friendly, while JSON is machine-friendly. YAML is more flexible than JSON, and it can be used to store a wider range of data types. JSON is more compact than YAML, and it is often used for data transfer between applications.

### What is the difference between YAML and XML?
YAML and XML are both data serialization languages, but they have some key differences. YAML is human-friendly, while XML is machine-friendly. YAML is more flexible than XML, and it can be used to store a wider range of data types. XML is more compact than YAML, and it is often used for data transfer between applications.
