We're using an `XML` output format for a game story synopsis. The document begins with the input elements (`title`, `synopsis`, and `beginning`), followed by the markdown code block for the main part of the story. This code block should only include XML tags and should be wrapped within a `<code>&lt;!--Story Synopsis-->` container. The XML should be outputted with only the XML in the container, wrapped within `<code>&lt;!--End-->` tags.
