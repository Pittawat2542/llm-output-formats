The beginning of the game. The player wakes up in their room, confused and disoriented. They slowly piece together the events of the previous night as flashes of memory come back to them. The player steps into the sunlight, feeling a sense of unease. Looking up, they notice a large shadowy figure looming behind them. The figure raises a hand in greeting.

The player: "Wait..." they mutter, barely recognizing their own voice as it echoes in their head. "Where... where did I..." They start to back away slowly, and the figure: "Go back... you have unfinished business... with the destiny that awaits you..." The player: "What destiny?" The figure: "A destiny filled with... adventure."
