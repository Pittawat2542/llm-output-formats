The XML code block is wrapped in curly braces and contains a `title` tag that identifies the game, a `synopsis` tag that contains the game story synopsis, and two `beginning` and `ending` tags respectively that indicate the start and end of the game. The `synopsis` tag should be placed inside the `beginning` and `ending` tags to ensure that the full story does not get included, only the synopsis.
