Using the Markdown syntax tags, the above code can be written as follows:

```markdown
## Output format
- Output a game title using the title tag.
- Encode the synopsis of the game title using the synopsis tag.
- Encode both the beginning and ending of the game using the beginning and ending tag respectively.
```

This should produce an output that looks like the following:

```xml
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>the ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```
