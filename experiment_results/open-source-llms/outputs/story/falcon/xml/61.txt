In this example, the `game` element contains two child elements, `title` and `synopsis`. The `title` element contains the name of the game, and the `synopsis` element contains the game's story synopsis. Inside the `title` element, there is also an `opening` tag that defines the beginning of the game. Inside the `synopsis` element, there is an `ending` tag that defines the end of the game. To generate the XML output, the entire Markdown block will be processed as one element with two tags.
