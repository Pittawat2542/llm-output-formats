In this example, the XML code consists of a `game` tag representing a top-level element and two child elements, `title` and `synopsis`. The `title` element is used to give a unique name to the game, while the `synopsis` element contains the actual story synopsis. It is important to only include the contents of the `synopsis` element in the `Markdown` code block since this is the most important information for players.
