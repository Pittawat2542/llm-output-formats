The `game:` tag at the top is used to define the name of the game. Below this are two sub-tags, `beginning` and `ending`. The `game.ending` is the section of the story where the game ends. The `game.beginning` is a section which introduces the game and the main characters. 

Finally, there should be the title of the game in the `title:`. For example, if it's "Superhero City Adventures", it should be `title: Superhero City Adventures`.
