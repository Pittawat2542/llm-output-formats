In The Beginning, a new game was announced to the world by a mysterious corporation known only as 'The Order'. The game promised incredible power, wealth, and the ability to live a life of luxury for those who were chosen to participate. Of course, many were curious and eager to know more, so the game was quickly oversubscribed.

Many competitors soon entered the race to secure the coveted position, only to find out that winning was not as simple as it seemed. Several players were eliminated along the way, while others faced unexpected challenges that tested their skills and endurance.

Eventually, the most elite players in the world were brought to an isolated location where the true purpose of the game was revealed. It was a chance to reshape the world, to create power from the chaos, and to establish order. But with power comes great responsibility, and not everyone was sure if they wanted that kind of responsibility.
