# Markdown code block
- Markdown content, encapsulated in either comments (`-`) or a specific file format.

You can use YAML syntax to create key-value pairs within an object. Use `-` to indicate lines which define variables. Comments are allowed using `-` at the beginning of a line except where they need to form part of the object definition.
