The world has been shattered, and humanity clings to what's left. In the aftermath, civilization is shattered and everyone has to work hard to survive. You play as a survivor in the wasteland, who must fight for their life and take what they can find. Along the way, you will come across both fellow travelers and dangerous bandits. The challenge is to make the best use of your limited resources and skills to stay alive, while also avoiding the risks you encounter. #YAML -->

The synopsis is a single line that uses the ``` character to mark the beginning of the game story. The beginning is set at the beginning of the game or shortly thereafter, depending on how the text is being interpreted and formatted. The ending can also be set at a later point in the game if desired. The title has been provided in markdown code block format. Both of these sections have been wrapped in a YAML code block to indicate their importance.
