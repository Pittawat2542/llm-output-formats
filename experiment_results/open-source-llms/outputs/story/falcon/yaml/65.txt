In the beginning, there was a galaxy in chaos. Unknown forces had brought the Empire to the brink of collapse and a new order was being forged. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story tells the story of one daring mission to restore hope to the galaxy. 

As a new hero, a daring, elite group of soldiers called the "Rogue One" had been tasked by the Alliance to infiltrate a secret Imperial weapons facility deep inside their research station on the planet Scarif to retrieve the designs of the dreaded Death Star - the moon-sized superweapon with which the Empire has been able to wipe out entire planets.

The mission is a daring one, and each member of the Rogue One knows the risks, but with their courage and their determination, the mission goes ahead. As they reach the research facility, they're met with a surprise attack by the Imperial forces on the ground, and the fight is on.

The Rogue One will have to infiltrate the facility and fight their way through heavily fortified locations, take advantage of tactical advantages and use all of their wit and skill to turn the tide against the Empire, and ultimately take control of the Death Star.


Scarif -- the first stop on the galaxy's most dangerous mission. The fate of the galaxy rests with you.
