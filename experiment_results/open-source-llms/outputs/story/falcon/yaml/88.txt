One cold day, they reunite to play a game of basketball. Their match is more intense than expected, leading to a heated rivalry between each other. As they continue to play, their friendship and rivalries reign supreme. But during the match, a bizarre twist of fate happens; an alien comes out of nowhere and impales John Johnson with its sharp beam. The alien then demands a ransom of the basketball game in return for him healing John... can the game go on?
