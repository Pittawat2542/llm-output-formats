# Game information 
A game title is defined only once here, at the beginning of the game YAML file, and is rendered directly. 
A synopsis is rendered between the beginning and ending of the game.
The output is defined in the markdown code block, where the beginning and ending of the game, game title, and synopsis are rendered as YAML.
