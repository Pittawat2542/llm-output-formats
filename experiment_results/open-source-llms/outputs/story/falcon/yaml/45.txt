### Markdown code block
- Begin here
- If you're using tags in your Markdown, define them here
- Use the code block syntax by enclosing sections in YAML triple-quotes
- If using tables, enclose the table inside triple-quotes and use double-quotes for table sections
- To embed YAML code, set the `YAMLLink` option to `JSON`

Example of a code block:
- `#if` the code follows the same logic as a triple-quoted section
- `if` condition
- `then` section within the code block
- `endif` section within the code block
- `else` if condition
- `endif` if condition
