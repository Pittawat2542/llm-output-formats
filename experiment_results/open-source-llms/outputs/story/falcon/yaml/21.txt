YAML can be added by editing the Markdown code block (typically using a text editor) and using `YAML.add_line()` to format the input with the desired structure. These should only be the YAML content. 

Return output in a single YAML block to validate against the input format:

```yaml
game:
  beginning: The beginning of the game
  ending: The ending of the game
  synopsis: This is the synopsis of my game
  title: This is my game title
```
