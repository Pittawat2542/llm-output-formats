# Markdown code block
- The first markdown code block is a function that generates JSON data for the game synopsis based on input parameters like game title and synopsis.
- The second markdown code block assigns the beginning and ending of the game to corresponding JSON properties.
- Within the JSON, the synopsis property is used to store the game story synopsis text.
- The returned output in JSON format is wrapped in a single object, marked with a property named "game".
