The player takes on the role of an astronaut aboard a space ship that is sent to collect data from a mysterious planet. As they approach the planet and orbit around it, players must gather data and complete objectives to progress through the game. The story begins with the player receiving a distress call from a shipwrecked astronaut and must use their wits to piece together what happened to the ship and save the crew. The game ends when all objectives are complete or when the player reaches a certain point in the story.

As the player completes objectives, they gain more information about the planet and its creatures. As they explore and gather data, they learn there is a powerful being controlling the planet and its creatures. The player must balance completing their objectives with stopping this being from taking complete control of the planet while also preventing the planet from being destroyed.
