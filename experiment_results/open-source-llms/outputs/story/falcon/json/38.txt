In this markdown, we are presenting a game synopsis that contains game title, synopsis, and story synopsis. The game title is followed by a short synopsis that highlights the game's main story points. Finally, we conclude with the game's climax and end, wrapped in curly braces. These JSON keys correspond to the placeholders in the code snippet below:
```object
game.title = "game title";
game.synopsis = "game story synopsis";
game.beginning = "the beginning of the game";
game.ending = "the ending of the game";
``` 

To include the synopsis in the JSON output, the Markdown code block using curly braces can be changed to the following:
```object
key: game.title | game.synopsis

key: game.beginning | game.ending
```
