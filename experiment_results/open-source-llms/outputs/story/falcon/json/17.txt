```JSON
{
    "game": {
        "title": "game title",
        "synopsis": 
    "A story of game(s) you've never played before. Follow the beginning and create your own ending within the story.",
    "beginning": "the beginning of the game of your choosing",
    "ending": 
}
```

In this example, the return value is a JSON string that contains a single key-value pair. The key is "game" which is represented as a dictionary with two properties - "title" and "synopsis". "title" contains a text representation of the game's title, and "synopsis" is JSON. The string starts with the title followed by commas and a single curly brace to enclose the object. Any JSON data is wrapped with quotes to identify it as a valid JSON.
