To convert Markdown into JavaScript code format, you can follow the steps below:

1. Remove any comments before and after the content of the text block.
2. Convert each line starting with the name followed by a dot (.), which represents the text on that line. These lines can be wrapped in the <code>span</code> tag so they become enclosed in tags.
3. Remove any spaces and newlines between tags, and wrap any tags or lines exceeding 200 characters in the class ".markdown-ignore".
4. Remove the ":" before and after the closing bracket of any multi-line blocks (e.g. @example).
5. Use the <code>backtick</code> and <code>backtick2</code> commands to create tags around specific text and attributes, respectively.
6. Convert the final result output to JSON format and remove the "JSON" text using string trimming in JavaScript.
