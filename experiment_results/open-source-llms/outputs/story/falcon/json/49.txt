In this example, "game" is a key in the JSON object that contains two sub-keys, "title" and "synopsis". The "title" key has been given an empty string for identification purposes, while the "synopsis" key holds the game's narrative story synopsis. Also, note that the keys within the sub-keys are also formatted using markdown syntax for JSON objects.
