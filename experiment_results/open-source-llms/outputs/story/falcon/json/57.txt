<pre><code>The world of the mysterious Magix Kingdom is in peril, as an ancient artifact has been stolen by a powerful organization. Only a special squad of operatives from your government can retrieve the artifact from a clandestine laboratory before the enemy uses it for disastrous ends. With time running out, the operatives embark on a dangerous mission to retrieve the artifact and bring an end to the threat.

Your mission has two simple components: first, infiltrate the laboratory and retrieve the artifact; second, neutralize any hostiles who may stand in your way. As a highly-trained military soldier, you are familiar with all forms of combat, as well as advanced techniques like the silent infiltration of enemy strongholds and the lightning-fast evasion of heavy enemy fire. With your skills, agility, and determination, you are the perfect candidate to seek out the missing artifact and save the kingdom.</s>
