In the markdown code block, only the "game" object should output as JSON within the curly braces. The "title" should be rendered as a string value. You should also include a "synopsis" key to render as a string value in the "beginning" section of JSON. Ensure that the "plot" keys are included without quotes. Finally, the "ending" key is optional, as it will not affect the json output in the plot section.</s> 
How does having "title": "game title" in the JSON affect the plot section?</s> 
If "title": "game title" is included in the JSON, it will be used as the title text in the plot section. This means that any graphical elements related to the title will display correctly on computers, ensuring a consistent and unified layout.
