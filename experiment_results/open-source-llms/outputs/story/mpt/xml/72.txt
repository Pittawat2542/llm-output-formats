Synopsis: The planet of Eden was ravished and overthrown by a horrifying menace known as the Insectoids. In an attempt to preserve human kind, a spacecraft with few supplies and a handful of warriors embarked to find a new home for humanity in the stars. These pioneers of Earth's survival were known as the Starfleet Academy cadets.

The cadets on board the vessel called the U.S.S. Enterprise, led by Kirk, were on a three-year mission to seek out new life, and new civilizations. With no certainty of success, the Enterprise would risk everything to find a way for humanity to survive.
