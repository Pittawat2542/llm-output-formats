Synopsis:

The game begins with the discovery of an ancient artifact, which was found when a survey ship was swept away in a powerful whirlpool.  Shortly after, an armada of pirate ships appeared on the horizon, and chased the ship.  The crew managed to communicate the location of the ship to the government, but they arrived too late.  The ship had been destroyed, and all the crew rescued.

The player is given control of a newly built ship tasked with hunting down and destroying the pirate fleet.  The player has several choices in how they play the game, ranging from stealth, to all-out attack.  Each course of action will lead to different results, but ultimately, the player must destroy the pirate fleet before they can launch another attack on the main ship, and continue terrorizing the oceans.
