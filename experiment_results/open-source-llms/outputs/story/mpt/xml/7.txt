	<title>The Last Knight</title>
	<synopsis>The great war between the dragons and mankind continues. As the last dragon knight, it is up to you to lead your dragon into battle and take back the Kingdom of England.</synopsis>
	<beginning>After the terrible war between the dragons and mankind five years ago that nearly ended all life on earth, the great dragon, Azur, still mourns the loss of her hatchlings that were killed during the conflict. Despite her grief and the fact that all of the remaining dragons have left this land to travel beyond known borders to seek out a new place to survive, Azur continues to fight for the people she can protect and care for. Now, she has heard the news that the most cunning of all the human knights, Sir Kay, is once again stirring the hearts of other knights around the land with his tales of a new war and the necessity that everyone must once again don armored suits of armor to stand a chance against the dragons. When Sir Kay also calls forth the powerful red dragon, Fyre, to join in his rallying of the knights, Azur is forced to choose - should she once again put on her armor and fight for a world that has wronged her or should she continue her mourning and hope that other dragons will step up to take her place. Knowing that dragonkind must prevail over mankind, Azur decides that she shall once again don her armor and join her brothers and sisters in protecting what remains of the kingdom of England.</beginning>
	<ending>Fighting through an army of thousands of men in shining suits of armor, Azur and Fyre descend upon the capital city of London, known as Chequers. The knights attempt to overwhelm the two mighty dragons, but their attacks do little more than knock dents into the dragons' massive shields. While Sir Kay rides his fire-breathing stallion to draw the attention of the great dragons, he is shot down by a crossbow bolt thrown by one of his own knights. Kay lands hard in the dirt and his horse rams into the side of Azur and her dragon, knocking them both to the ground. Azur is able to recover quickly and stand up to continue battling with Kay's knight. Unable to remove her helm, and unsure where all of the knights in the surrounding city have gone, Azur and Fyre quickly turn to face the human army.</ending>
