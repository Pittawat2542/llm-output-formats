Here is an example that I wrote for this task:

## Example:
Lara Croft was raised by her father, archeologist and treasure hunter, who taught her about secret societies, ancient relics, and the art of survival. 

Lara now travels the world to uncover lost treasures and stop evils forces seeking to destroy her.

On her latest adventure, Lara must stop the nefarious, Trinity organization from collecting a powerful ancient relic that will give them ultimate power.
