Here is some example text:

The planet X is a hotbed of intrigue: a volatile mix of political and economic systems, and under constant threat from the forces of darkness beyond their borders.  The planet, controlled by a central authority, consists of thirteen disparate regions called "zones", each with their own government and culture.  Into this environment steps Sam, an employee of the Federal Information Bureau, who is charged with bringing together the disparate regions with a new communication system.  The stakes are high: if the zones fail to work together, the entire planet could be destroyed by alien invaders.  Sam embarks on a perilous quest, facing dangerous situations and unlikely alliances as he struggles to complete his mission.
