It was the morning of a day like any other, with the only exception being that the villagers of this town were expecting something extraordinary. While the residents of the town went about their mornings, preparing for work or play, a team of heroes worked in secret in a dark room, deep underground."  Ending with: "It takes months, even years, of quiet work, late nights and dedication to the art of crafting a legend worthy of being told in the campfires and around the fires of hearths. All for the sake of the legend that would one day set sail toward the skies."  </synopsis>
