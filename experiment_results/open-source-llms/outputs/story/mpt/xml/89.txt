	<beginning>Terraria was released in 2011 by Re-Logic Games and has been praised as one of the greatest 2D games ever made. Many consider this "blocky" sandbox game to be one of the deepest games, with so many elements of gameplay and mechanics that it would take multiple lifetimes to truly experience the game.</beginning>
	<ending>The story in Terraria takes place in a world called "The Overworld", and the events of each new run are separated into many sections. One section is always "home", with the player starting at a random biome, and many others include randomly-generated areas such as dungeons, caves, or volcanoes, with a wide variety of enemies, items, and bosses.</ending><!--
Terraria is a sandbox 2.5D action-adventure game developed by Re-Logic and published by 505 Games. First released in 2011, the game was created as a spiritual successor to two similar titles, Dwarf Fortress and Cave Story. Terraria features randomized levels procedurally generated in a 2D side-scrolling landscape, where the gameplay centers on the exploration and survival elements in single-player and multiplayer, set in a fantasy-inspired context. It was praised for its fast-paced combat, character progression, crafting system, world-building elements, and customization features.<

Terraria was met with critical acclaim. The game received a "Game of the Year" nomination from IGN and received critical acclaim for its game design, level design, and multiplayer features. The game was also praised for having a deep crafting system, extensive use of randomization with many items and worlds, huge inventory space, and extensive use of pixel art; however, the character design drew criticism and some reviewers considered it too similar to Dwarf Fortress, which has more in common with the game's predecessor Cave Story, though many reviewers found the combat system to be far more interesting than Cave Story. Terraria has been called one of the greatest 2D games; IGN and GameSpy named it the "Game of the Year" in 2011 for the PC platform, and numerous "Game of the Year" awards for the console platforms followed in 2012.<

As of May 2021, Terraria has had over twenty million players across its console and PC platforms, which was the publisher's best-selling video game on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network during the same time. It also has had over five million players on Steam, and over ten million players on iOS and Android platforms. The game is known for its large modding community and supports several multiplayer modes with multiple players across several platforms, including console, PC, Android, and iOS, in both single-player and online multiplayer, and offers free updates that add new items and content to the game. Terraria received an upgrade to version 1.4 "Engine Update" in 2017, adding new features and gameplay
