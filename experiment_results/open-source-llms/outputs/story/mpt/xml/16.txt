# game story synopsis

The protagonist awoke to a scream. Startled, he glanced around, but couldn’t find the source. Confused, he tried to sit up, but failed. He could barely move. His vision blurred, but he had no choice but to keep looking around. Finally he found the source of the scream: a guard, dead at his feet. A second later a second guard fell, struck down from behind. He scrambled over to the bodyguards, but before he could stop the assassin, the latter used a throwing knife to take out another guard. The third guard screamed, and as the protagonist managed to look up, he was also attacked by the assassin. The protagonist’s strength was spent, but he knew he had to get out of there. Finally, after a short time, he managed to push open the door. Looking around frantically, he quickly noticed the exit.

"Help!" he cried. "Help!" but the door slammed in his face by the assassin before they could escape. With difficulty, the protagonist climbed into an overturned wooden cart. Just as the assassin had blocked the exit, it was only a corner or two away from the entrance to a tunnel that lead to the castle. If he could get out of the wooden cart before the assassin found him, he would at least have some chance to survive.

"Come on, you're not getting away that easily!" the hunter called behind him, wielding an axe. 
The woodsman, who the protagonist had previously met in the forest, emerged from the bushes and attacked the hunter. The woodsman wasn't slow or weak, but he was no match for the hunter, who had practiced in this wood for many years. In the end, the woodsman surrendered and was led away, a sad look in his eyes.

All that happened very quickly, but now the woodsman would tell him everything. But the woodsman had to be found, and with that in mind, the protagonist went to the woods to continue his search. As he walked through the forest, thick trees surrounded him, with the sounds of buzzing insects and crickets permeating the air.

The woodsman met him in a clearing. "It's not easy to live off the land in this forest," he said. "To be good at everything, this is needed:

- Perseverance
- Practicing and self-confidence
- Observation
The forest would always win in the end.

"What?" the protagonist asked. "I can't understand a word." the woodsman replied.
At the end of the forest was the old castle. The woodsman led him in through a hole, and once inside, the protagonist took the opportunity to search the woodsman's bags. There he found a small leather bag, which he took with him, also taking an axe that was in the woodsman's bag. "That's okay, it'll be easier to find." he replied. It was time to enter the castle.

Soon he heard the sounds of fighting. "Come on, I'm sure you've gotten good enough!" the woodsman called out. He rushed into the scene, but the lights had been turned off so that it was a little difficult to see. The woodsman quickly turned the lights back on and began to explain the situation. The guard tried to scare him away, but the woodsman beat him with his axe. The hunter then saw the woodsman behind him and began to cry. "I know him," the woodsman answered. "He just cut a guard's throat, and he's coming for me now. I can't let him come after me!" The woodsman told him. "If you run, you'll end up being captured."

He couldn't believe his ears. "That's horrible!" he shouted. The woodsman could only shake his head sadly and continue explaining that the hunter could take the guard for him and take him to the next level of the castle. The man's plan was to ambush the huntress. But in the end the woodsman had managed to prevent the hunter from reaching his goal.
