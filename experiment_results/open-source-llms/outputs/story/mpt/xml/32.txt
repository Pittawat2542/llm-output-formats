	<title>The Trolls of the Forest Kingdom</title>
	<synopsis>
	A young boy, Bingo, was traveling through the forest kingdom with his mother. Suddenly, Bingo realized that there was something chasing them. It was his friend Trolli, a troll from a faraway land. Trolli had been turned into a small, blue, and slightly creepy toy by an evil witch and was now chasing Bingo and his mother. The chase was interrupted, however, by a beautiful princess who asked Bingo to help her.
	It was at this point that Bingo realized that he was in fact the prince of the forest kingdom. He quickly befriended the princess and revealed to her the truth about himself, his mother, and Trolli. The story ended with a happy ending, with Trolli becoming a real troll again thanks to the magic of the evil witch.
