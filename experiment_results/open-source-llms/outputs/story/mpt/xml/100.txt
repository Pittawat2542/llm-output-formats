Game Synopsis:

In a world where monsters are real, an orphan girl named Kat moves to live with her uncle. They are both professional monster hunters, but their latest case is different from any of the other cases Kat has seen before.

An ancient dragon is destroying villages and eating any living thing it comes across. But as Kat gets closer to the dragon she discovers that it is not like any dragon she has seen before. Why doesn't the dragon just kill Kat?
