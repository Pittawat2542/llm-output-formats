Here is an example in markdown. We can use xml to format it in any way we like.  This particular example would look like this:
```xml

<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>the ending of the game</ending>
</game>
