It's a peaceful afternoon early Spring in the town of Smallville. The sun is out, the birds are chirping, and a nice breeze is blowing. The town is busy with school kids out on their spring break and others running errands. You can see a variety of outdoor activities going on, from kids playing baseball to joggers running down the sidewalk. Several families are enjoying a nice stroll in the park, admiring all the beauty Mother Nature put on display this time of year. There isn't much of a crowd in the park as it is still a little early in the day. It should pick up as the hours progress. And as the people are going about their daily lives, you can hear the faint hum of a high-pitched sound. A sound similar to that found on UFO sightings or a police chase. At first, the sound is a bit faint, but the closer you come to the source, the more you'll notice it. It seems to be coming from one of the flowerbeds by the walkway. And as you get even closer, you notice there are three small, round flowers, each with a small black dot in the center of each petal. You take a closer look at the flowerbed and see a couple of small plants growing in the dirt, with only a couple of leaves and a stem connecting the plant to the ground. As you step even closer, you see a small tunnel hole leading into the dirt. You put your face about 1 foot away from one of the plants, and you see a small button on the side of the stem. Upon pushing the button, you hear a distinct, high-pitched, metallic sound. You look at the other two plants and see the same exact thing. There are three plants with one in each flowerbed. You put your face up to one of the plants and push the button. After a couple of seconds, all the small plants begin to shake, and start to move forward. They quickly begin to rise out of the flowerbed and dig into the ground with sharp claws on their toes. It seems that there is a large tunnel system starting from these plants. You start to follow where they are crawling and begin to see faint tracks from the plants in the dirt.
