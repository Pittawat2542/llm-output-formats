Sure, here's an example of a story:

A robot named John-Boy was given the chance to create any robot that he wanted, but there was a catch: he had to create it in the time it took to count to 10. So John-Boy started building robots, one by one, starting as soon as he was presented with the task.

He quickly learned the value of keeping it simple. All of his robots were similar, but had just enough variability to pass the test when given a specific task. When building robots, he would make his initials his own, but then add in simple variations for his other robots.

Eventually, John-Boy had created robots for just about any task, especially ones that required a great deal of dexterity. He was able to build a robot whose sole purpose was to make other robots!

John-Boy continued to build robots, never truly knowing what the end goal was, but knowing there would be one if he continued to build. He simply wanted to see what could be done in the given time given only simple tools.

Eventually, John-Boy completed the task, and knew then what had been presented to him was impossible. But was it his best effort? He knew it had to be.
