  <beginning>
     "Where am I?" The player asks themselves in a haze.
     They have woken up on the ground in an unfamiliar location with what seems to be a pile of rubble for protection. They try to move, but find
     that their arm is still strapped to the table they landed on.
     They notice two men walking into the room, and try to move their head to face them. They don't get far though, and soon notice the
     men are holding some sort of large axe. The player takes
     a brief glance behind themselves, and notices a large hole in the wall, with bricks and mortar laying in a pile on the
     floor.
