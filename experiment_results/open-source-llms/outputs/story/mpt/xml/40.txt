game story synopsis
the beginning of the game
the player awoke disoriented and confused.  It was dark except for the light coming from the cave entrance.   As he opened his eyes, he noticed that someone was standing in front of him.  The person was asking him for guidance. 

the player asked what was going on.

the person answered that he was in some kind of afterlife.  He asked if he had ever lost anyone close to him.  The player replied no.

the person told him that he had just been struck by lightning.  The player asked him if he was in heaven.  The person told him he was not in heaven but in some other place.  He was not with his maker yet, but would be soon.  

The player did not understand so he asked if the person could tell him what heaven was like.

The person replied that he did not know anything about that place.  Then the person told him that it had not been a direct lightning strike that had killed him.  It was lightning that had been attracted to him from afar.   

The person said that the lightning had been attracted to him by his presence and he was in fact a cloud.
