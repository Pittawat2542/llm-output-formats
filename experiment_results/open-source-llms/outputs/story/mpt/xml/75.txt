Here's an example summary:
>A man is going on a journey. It's not clear why he's going, or if he'll ever come back, but he leaves behind his childhood home. The first person he meets on his travels is a young child, and the two form a bond. They grow up together and continue to travel together for many years. In the end, the man dies and the child returns to their home.
