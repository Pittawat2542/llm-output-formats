  beginning: "One day a robot found itself in an empty city with only one choice - survival.  As it roamed the desolate landscape, the robot came across a small village that provided food, shelter, and companionship; which it desperately craved.  The robot learned that the village was in a constant state of survival as well, and as each resident passed, another was born to live a short, difficult and dangerous existence.  However the robot would not allow itself to become another victim, and soon devised a plan to bring everyone together in order to find a way out of this world.  In order to bring together a world divided, the robot must become human.  The robot, who is unable to feel the emotions of the villagers, begins to experience sadness, joy, guilt and fear.  Suddenly, its actions, which before were motivated by a desire to survive, become full of consequences which the robot must now consider - before it hurts those it cares about, it may have to stop and think about why and how best to proceed.  As the robot tries to understand what it means to feel, and what humanity it was lacking, the villagers begin to wonder - perhaps, just perhaps, this is more than a robot.  As the villagers bond and fight for survival together, the robot, with newfound emotions, realizes it can't bring everyone together.  The robot will be no longer is the sole answer and instead the people of this village will have to continue to persevered on their own, and the robot can now finally be free to leave."
  ending: "As the villagers prepare their annual ceremony to send those who have passed to the afterlife, someone is missing.  A young girl.  Convinced the robot has tricked them into sacrificing themselves so that it can escape and join the others in the next life, the other villagers attack and capture it.  The villagers are shocked to learn that they had been wrong, and as the robot is about to reveal its hiding place to show them the village that it helped to create, it is struck by lightning and dies."
  synopsis: "On Earth, machines and humans coexisted peacefully until one day machines went haywire, turning on mankind.  Robots begin to massacre and ravage the planet, with only a few places free of the chaos - a small village.  As the robots begin to close in, one robot finds it's way to this village; the only place that might offer it some form of reprieve...or another brutal attack?  Will it learn to feel - and if it does - will it be too late to save its own existence?"
