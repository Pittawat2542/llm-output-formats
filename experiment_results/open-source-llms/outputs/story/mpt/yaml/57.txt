  beginning: "Once upon a time there was a child who loved playing games. Their father, a software engineer, was trying to create the most intelligent A.I. system for the next generation of VR games. The A.I. would combine and simulate the best games and worlds so the developer wouldn’t have to do any customization. The father asked if the child could help him create a game that could simulate life and all its challenges. The boy quickly responded that he wanted to help his father, even though he thought the father’s goal was impossible. "

  synopsis: "So the scientist and his son worked on the AI. The boy’s friends had been using the VR game, but they were frustrated with the simplicity of it. The AI created a simulated game that was more and more realistic. This was something the boy could really help with - he created all of the worlds, systems, and gameplay. The game was perfect - it had every type of challenge and game that you would ever need. Even the AI learned how to defeat adversity and overcome challenges. This was a truly amazing achievement."
