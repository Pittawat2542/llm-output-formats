Beginning, in a barren land, two travelers, a man and a woman, meet. They are both running from their failures, the man from the wars he lost, the woman from her past that haunts her future, from the monsters she cannot fight. She tells him of the dark magic she learned, how it is her sole weapon for the fight. The man, who looks like a warrior, reminds her that she only has one hand with which to fight. As she is lost in her memories, the man, who is actually a knight in armor as a giant beast approaches. It is all her can do to see him, her memory failing her, as he tells her they must take a path toward their past to find the dragon that destroyed their lives then, and now. They set to the path, determined not to lose, and in doing so find not only their past and her mother but strength in each other as well.

The two are drawn to the city, each carrying a part of their past and a part of their future, and, with the knowledge and strength of how and where to move to defeat the dragon.

When they arrive in the city, after fighting off a group of bandits who attack the travelers, they discover that the city is destroyed, the buildings are all collapsed, and only a few people have survived. In the midst of the devastation, the knight sees his father, his father's killer, and the three fight, the knight drawing his sword, the man remembering his friend, who died protecting him, in turn, defending his son. The fight draws the attention of the dragon that roams the city and begins breathing fire, which destroys the city further.

The knight and man run to the dragon's lair through a tunnel constructed of rubble. They fight the dragon but, with the dragon weakened, the man, who never could fight before, is strong, destroying the dragon, proving his belief that she could fight with one hand, which she had shown early in the story.

They emerge in an unfamiliar place to find the woman running, her past and her future following her, she who had never been able to defend herself or others. She and the knight tell her their story as he tells a woman of his past life to show her he is her companion. They are met by the man's mother. The man, she, and knight remember the moment of their failure; the man's, his past and his father's killer's failure to protect his son, the knight's is his failure to protect his sister, to which they both had not protected their family.

On the way to the city, the man, holding the boy, who was once the man's son, tells the story of his son learning to fight on his own and his failure to protect his son as his son learns to fight on his own and fails. They walk through the destroyed city to their cottage, where they find, after defeating the dragon, the knight's mother and the woman's mother. Both are happy to see their children and tell of their triumphs and the family, who no longer knows fear, who must now fight the beast who still roams the city. It is to ensure their family's survival that they now, the man and woman, prepare to fight the dragon once more.

They return to the city, now a place of destruction that, once fought, will rise again. Alongside their parents and those who survived, they once again fight the dragon, but this time, they destroy the beast.
