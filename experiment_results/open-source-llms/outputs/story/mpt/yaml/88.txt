  beginning: one day, a girl named Ashley woke up early and got changed into her usual outfit. She was excited because her favourite celebrity (named Kira) was coming to her school today. She went downstairs for breakfast, where her sister, Jessie, was annoyed at her for waking up so early. They ate their usual food and Ashley finished her meal quickly. She quickly threw her bag in the car but her mother was running late, so Ashley got out of the car and called a cab. She got in and the driver asked her her destination. She responded, "The Shatner School", and continued to watch some YouTube videos on her phone during the ride. When she arrived, she took the elevator to the sixth floor where she was greeted by her friends. "Well, it's great to see you, Shatner!", called out one of them, "You missed me, Gomer!" replied Shatner. The pair shared a hug and talked about how great life was. The rest of the class soon gathered outside and began asking her questions, which she answered enthusiastically. "It's been great knowing you, kids! See you around!" she said before heading off to her next lesson. She then sat down and began reading a book. During a break between classes, she sat down and began reading a book. It was called "The Joy Luck Club". As she was reading, she began to cry and tell the teacher how sad she was that her mother had died.

The teacher quickly went and found Ashley's mother and told her what her daughter had said. Ashley's mother immediately went to her daughter's room and asked what was wrong. Ashley explained to her mother that she had begun reading a book called The Joy Luck Club and that the story was reminding her of her mother. She also told her mother that she missed her mother dearly. Ashley's mother then told her daughter that her mother used to take her to the Joy Luck Club when Ashley was a child. For Ashley, it was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen. She said it smelled like heaven and she would love to visit it again someday. Her mother then took Ashley outside and showed her the club. Her eyes lit up as she saw the beautiful grounds and delicious food. They sat down at a table and began to eat some delicious food. The server brought them some drinks and asked if they wanted more food. They both replied that they would like some additional rice and vegetables. They then continued their meal and talked about how life was. Ashley's mother told her daughter about a dream she had when she was a child. She told her daughter that even though her mother was far away, she would always be with her, in her heart, forever and always. Ashley's eyes began to tear up at this point, so her mother began to hug her and tell her everything was going to be okay.

They left the club and began to walk back to Ashley's house. Outside, Jessie was waiting by the car with a new doll that she had bought from the doll's store. Ashley's mother spoke to her as she walked out of the club, telling her how proud she was of her daughter and how far she had come. They then reached the car and began the drive home. On the way there, Ashley's mother spoke with Shatner, telling him how much she loved him and how, if Shatner were real, he would come to her funeral. Ashley's mother finished her story by saying, "Farewell, Gomer. I'll see you around." Shatner replied, "Oh I am real, but I was more than a figment of your imagination all along. I saw you smiling and I know you will carry my joy, my spirit, with you for as long as you live. Until we meet again, Ashley. I'll see you again." Shatner then disappeared into the air.

Ashley got out of the car and quickly walked inside her house. Her mother was already waiting for her. "Oh, my dear, you're home!", she exclaimed. Ashley's father was also there and they all greeted each other happily. Jessie soon joined them and the family began to eat the food Ashley's mother had made them for dinner. As Ashley's father started a story, Ashley interrupted him and told him she had just met Shatner and he had given her some advice. Her father then told her a story of how he met Shatner in college. Ashley then told her parents she had read a book and cried a lot and that the story was a message from her mother. Her father then told her story about the dreams he had in college, and how he met Shatner and how he told her he was a real character and would live with her forever and ever. Jessie then told the story of how she met Shatner at a fair and how he taught her to be kind and how he gave her a gift. When Ashley was done telling her story, she began to cry again.
