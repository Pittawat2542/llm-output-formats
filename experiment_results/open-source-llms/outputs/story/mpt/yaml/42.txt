story:

The King of the Western Dominion of Wayfare was a fair ruler until the day a group of demons called the Black Blades started attacking his villages. They murdered his men and kidnapped the children, hoping that the King's son would die. It wasn't long before the Blades declared war and began a reign of terror.

As the war spread to the surrounding realms, the most powerful knight in the West banded together with a band of outcasts, criminals, and rogues, along with a few loyal retainers, to stop the evil Blades from taking over the continent.

The heroic Knight and his followers had to save the King's Son, battle through hordes of monsters, uncover a deeper conspiracy, and put an end to the Black Blades' reign of terror once and for all, all while searching for a way to save the King's Son.
