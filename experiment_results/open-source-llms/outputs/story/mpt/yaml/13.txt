```yaml
game:
  beginning: the beginning of the game
  ending: the ending of the game
  synopsis: the game story synopsis
  title: the game title
```
Note that the returned yaml is valid YAML so we include the trailing newline that would otherwise be included if the output were returned as Markdown.

This format is specific for game story synopsis. For synopses about other types of stories, simply do not specify the "game" item, and the defaults will apply.
