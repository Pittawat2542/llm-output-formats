  title: Game
  beginning: 
     The world suddenly shifted to different dimensions and space-time!
     Fantasy creatures and heroes from legends sprung to life and fought!
  synopsis: 
     King Bard and his royal guards were ambushed by orc bands of all sorts.
     Heavy fighting ensued and many of his guards and servants lost their life
     to the many orc warriors. He and his few remaining guards retreated into the 
     castle as they could no longer fight with the numbers of the orcs!
     The remaining nobles were quick to surrender the castle to the Orcs as they didn't see 
     any hope left for the heroes. They surrendered the key to the castle door and the 
     key to the dungeon. 
  ending:
     The king and his band of loyal servants and fighters could no longer fend for themselves!
     To make matters worse, the king himself lost his right arm to an orc warrior. Their final
     hopes lie with the castle dungeon and the treasures within... if they can get the
     key to open the door! King Bard summoned his most talented warriors to get the key 
     from the orcs! The warriors, their leader, and the king all went into the dungeon
     to get the key. 
     The warriors and king did indeed face the orcs at the dungeon entrance. The warriors
     cleared the orcs and found the king's key! They used the key and entered into
     the deep dark realm of the dungeon. 
     The warriors fought through the many challenges of the dungeon. Many traps, foes, and 
     curse laid before them, and they fought their way to the heart of the dungeon. 
     They had reached the treasure room at last! Yet, all treasure chests were empty and 
     barren. The king and his warriors sat down dejected, yet triumphant. 
     Asking if the treasure chest were empty, they were told, that the orcs had the 
     treasures. The king and his warriors were outraged over how the world treated them!
     They knew they could no longer sit in the world and allow the things they once saw 
     on fantasy novels to be a reality. The king declared that if he were to see his 
     castle and all that he loved, he was to conquer that which caused this.
     The warriors and king all entered the dungeon. Fighting against the mighty orcs, they 
     cleared one hall after another. The last group of orcs were met in the far deep 
     caves of the dungeon. The fight was heavy. Yet, one by one, each warrior fell! Not one 
     till the last, and at this time, only the king was left alive. Not the king, only the 
     king himself was not enough! 
     He took out a magical blade, and summoned the magic of the blade! It summoned the 
     power of an ancient beast - a dragon! The dragon flew out to defend the king and 
     warriors! 
     The dragon's breath brought lightning down to the ground, burning the orcs and 
     their numbers! The king and warriors charged together to the final chamber. The 
     final battle - a final chance! 
     The king and his warriors stood at the heart of the dungeon and fought! Heavy blows 
     were struck by the king and his warriors, but they could not stand against all of the 
     orc warriors! With final heavy blows by the king to the orc champion themselves, the 
     orcs retreated back to the outside. 
     The king and his warriors stood victorious! 
     They looked at the castle, now a pile of dust. 
     The king and the few remaining warriors saw the orcs burning, the mountain they fled 
     to to escape the lightning. The king was saddened, but glad of his survival. 
     He realized he had to get his remaining men, treasure, and castle to safety, for 
     such danger to not ever come again!
