  beginning: "As a young woman, I was trapped by a mysterious cult for many years. Finally, I escaped on the day of my 18th birthday. I joined the police force and dedicated my life to destroying the cult and freeing the other victims like me. Fast forward to the present: I'm now a highly decorated detective and I've just received word that the leader of the cult is going by the name of "The Butcher". I've assembled a team of investigators to help me on what I know will be my final case before retirement. We will stop at nothing until we find the leader of this evil organization and end his reign of terror once and for all."
