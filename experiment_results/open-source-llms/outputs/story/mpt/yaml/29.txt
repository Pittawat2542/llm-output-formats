Cabin In The Woods (A First-person Puzzle Adventure) begins with the player waking up in the middle of the woods. In the distance, there are some cabins. The player looks around and notices they’re in an abandoned cabin. There isn’t much to do but walk out of the cabin and look around the forest. The first level featured a forest with a tree, a boulder, a path and a stream. The boulder could move around the forest, obstructing the player’s path.
