The king of a small kingdom, known for its lush mountains and magical springs, has lived in peace for many years, and is only concerned with the happiness and wellbeing of his subjects. But one day, a strange man arrives in the kingdom bearing news that will change everything for the king and his people. The king has only one question for the visitor: what is the purpose of his arrival?

The visitor explains that the kingdom’s safety is threatened by a powerful evil witch, and the king must make a difficult choice: defend his kingdom and sacrifice his freedom or surrender to the witch and secure the safety of his people. With the king’s blessing and the help of his trusted council members, the visitor begins to train the king in the magical arts and military strategies that will be needed to defeat the witch and protect the kingdom.

As the training progresses, the king becomes stronger and more confident, and he learns that great sacrifices must be made to protect the people he loves. In the end, he succeeds in defeating the witch and restoring peace to his kingdom, but at a great cost to himself.

Ultimately, the king learns that true power comes from sacrifices made for the sake of others, and he returns to his kingdom a wiser and more compassionate ruler.
