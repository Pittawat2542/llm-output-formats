Here's a simple story for a game called 'Hearthstone':

----

The story opens as a young Hearthstone enthusiast, Alex, is training hard to achieve the title “Raid Dungeon Master”. As Alex enters the dungeon, he meets a mysterious warrior named Keleseth at the entrance. Keleseth warns the young Alex that the dungeon is very dangerous and if Alex wishes to fight the evil Deathwing, Alex must first prove himself in battle, then Keleseth will let Alex enter the dungeon. Alex accepts the challenge and the epic combat between Alex and Keleseth ensues.

In the early turns of the game, Keleseth’s army is weakened by the young raider’s tactics. Keleseth calls out Deathwing to join the battle, and Deathwing is an impressive force. As the game progresses, Deathwing and Keleseth overwhelm Alex’s raiders, but Alex’s wit and resourcefulness keep him in the fight. Ultimately, Alex triumphed and Keleseth was defeated by Alex’s brave strategy and the assistance of Deathwing. As the game concluded, Alex had achieved the rank of Raid Dungeon Master and was welcomed into the Dungeon Master alliance.
