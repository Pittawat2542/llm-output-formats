Your game story should be one, or two, or three paragraphs at most. You may start on what, where and with who to get the game going, but the story must contain enough details to bring the reader to the ending of the game.

While the story is being developed, think about:
- What is the goal?
- What is the twist?
- Who is the villain?
- Who is the protagonist?
- How is the game resolved?

Be sure to write the story using the 2nd person perspective.
