game:
  beginning: "The main character woke up. They had been at the library, but had left early due to bad weather. On the way home, it started raining and the roads were very dangerous to drive. The roads were slick and flooded in several places, and rain drops were blinding them. They had taken many twists and turns to get home, and were very exhausted from being out in the cold and rain so long. As they finally arrived home, they ran into the house, dropped off their bag, and jumped into bed."
  ending: "The main character was getting ready to head out the next day. They had a bunch of errands to run, as well as some appointments. They had been up late working on a presentation for work, but knew they needed to keep going in order to get the work done properly. Once they were done with all their errands, they hoped to relax and get some sleep."
  synopsis: "The main character was running out of time. They had so much to do in such a short amount of time, and could not keep up. They were hoping they could get everything finished in time, as well as finish their work presentation for their job. They felt overwhelmed and stressed, and just wanted everything to be over with so they could finally relax and take a break."
