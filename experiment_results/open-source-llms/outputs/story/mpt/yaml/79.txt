  synopsis: The peaceful kingdom of Shire had only known prosperity until the day that their king fell gravely ill, and there was no hope of a cure. King Reginald had two sons, the eldest Reginald and the youngest, Reginald, known as Reginald Cyan to distinguish him from his father.
  title: The Lonely Princess
  beginning: Even the palace was silent around Reginald Cyan as he entered his father's bedchamber, now his family's temporary home.
  ending: Reginald Cyan grew up as the beloved son of the lonely King Reginald and Queen Alora. As the king's heir, he was treated like royalty, with every whim granted. When he wasn't dancing to his favorite song, or feasting on a plate of his favorite mashed potatoes, he could be found in a corner reading one of the many books his father had gifted him. One day, as he read a book about faraway lands, it was as if a fairy tale came to life.
