The beginning of the game is set on Earth, in a fictitious small, southern hemisphere town in South America. A team of researchers discovers the existence of extraterrestrial life on the planet Venus. Their team receives funding from a secret organization to take an expedition to Venus and meet with a powerful alien force which is capable of interstellar travel. The organization sends them to Venus, and their journey begins.

The team goes to space, traverses the sky of Venus and lands on its surface. Despite Venus' harsh environment, the team progresses toward their goal. 

The aliens are extremely powerful and more technologically advanced than any other life forms that the humans have encountered throughout the universe. Despite their technological superiority, the humans are terrified of their strength. The team discovers that the aliens hold one weakness, a technology called the Time-Space Alignment Chamber, or T.S.A.C. for short, which is one of the only tools in their arsenal capable of defeating them at all.

It's a race against time, as both teams struggle to develop this new technology and use it against one another. The outcome of this showdown will determine the fate of the planet---and possibly, the entire universe as well.
