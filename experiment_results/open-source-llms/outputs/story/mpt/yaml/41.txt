  synopsis: "It's the first season of the baseball season and it's mid-June.  The Tigers enter Tiger Stadium on a Saturday for a game.  The weather seems typical for the start of summer with temperatures in the high eighties and a light wind out to left field.  A packed house is on hand to witness the game.  Pitcher Alex White takes the mound for Detroit, facing off against Justin Verlander for the Twins.  White has an up-and-down season with an ERA under 4.00 but also a lot of home runs allowed.  Verlander, on the other hand, is one of the best in the league.  He's got a WHIP of 1.09, strikeouts per 9 innings of 11.04, an ERA of 2.29, and a FIP of 2.46.  He can be dominant when he's on, as he's shown this season."
