game:
  beginning: 
    "The game begins in a small town surrounded by rolling hills, nestled between a wide river and a forested valley. A young boy, no older than ten, wanders into the town square. A young girl of the same age looks on curiously and follows him to an abandoned warehouse in the back of the town. They sit down cross-legged on a pile of broken barrels and boxes, eager to show their treasure. The boy produces a battered old toy train set and pulls the tracks out from the box. He places the tracks in the middle of the room and connects the pieces, smiling as the train chugs forward on its own. The girl looks on in awe and wonder, her eyes wide as the boy presses the whistle button to start the engine."
  ending: 
    "The two children sit in the middle of the warehouse, surrounded by barrels and boxes. The boy plays with his trainset, while the girl looks around the room with a puzzled expression. The boy notices her curious gaze and stops playing to explain the setup. He tells here they are building a railroad network and are waiting for the tracks to be connected so they can move the trains from one side of the room to the other. The girl watches eagerly as the boy lays down tracks, connecting them with snapping and click sounds. She asks if they can move one of the trains from one of the tracks to another one, and the boy replies that it will take some time to connect all the tracks."
  synopsis: "The building is surrounded by tall green trees and a stream. The young boy and girl sit on a box, watching his trains clatter loudly from one track to another. The boy pulls out another train and sets it on the track to start the engine, and turns the dial to the desired destination. The engineer whistles loudly as the toy train chugs forward, moving from one track to another, over and around the rolling barrels and boxes that fill the room. The girl watches in wonder as the train chugs across the wooden tracks and around the curves, until it finally reaches the end of the track. She looks up at the young boy and smiles, asking if they can set up another track so they can move the train back to the start."
