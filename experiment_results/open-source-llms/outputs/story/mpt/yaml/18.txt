```yaml game:
  beginning: Begin as a child playing a game of hide-and-seek with your friends, hiding in the tall grass of a large field at sunset.  You run from the far corner of the field as your sibling, running across the field from the opposite corner, calls out to you that the game is over.  As you return to the grass, your friend, now hiding in the shadows of a nearby tree, calls out again that the game has begun and asks where you are.  A new game starts as you begin to hide in the tall grass once more.
  ending: The game progresses into adulthood, now with your own child playing in the field at sunset. The game is paused as darkness falls and the children begin their evening, but soon after they have fallen asleep you wake up from your own slumber, re-entering the game under the dim lamplight of dawn.  A new search is started in the large field, with grass and flowers to navigate and a winding path of trees leading to the trees of a small forest beyond.
  synopsis: you return to the past, returning to the field under a new, clear moon, as a child again playing the same game you remember.  The path remains the same, yet the flowers and trees are now older and some have grown back, their seeds passing through your family and into the hands of the past.  You continue to search, now exploring a dark cave, an ocean, and many other familiar places in the field.
