Game synopsis:
- “The kingdom’s most trusted knight, Sir Galahad, has volunteered to go on a quest to find out more about this witch and put a stop to her nefarious activities.”
- “He gathers a band of trusted companions to join him on this perilous journey: a sage for advice, a dwarf to provide technical expertise, and a fair maiden to act as mapmaker and keep their spirits high.”
- “Galahad is a humble man, and proud only to be trusted with such an important task. But he is confident in his skills and in the righteousness of his cause, and sets out boldly into the unknown.”
- “His first task will be to find some way into the witch’s lair, for even the bravest and most skilled fighter is no match for her enchanted weapons.”
- “He will have to be clever to evade her traps, and quick to react, for every step he takes could bring him one step closer to danger.”
- “He will have to be brave to face her alone, and even then he may not survive.”
- “But if he is successful, he will at least put an end to this threat to his kingdom and the safety of his people.”
