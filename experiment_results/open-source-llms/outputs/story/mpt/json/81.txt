Here is a game story synopsis:

The beginning of the game starts off in the fictional village of Gormley. The town is filled with all of the people from the game. The narrator is a student in one of the schools, in first grade. He lives with his mom and his dog on the outskirts of the village. The boy has two best friends. The first one he met when they were toddlers and is an only child. They have always done everything together. Together they explore the playground, and chase the dogs. The second friend is a bit older, but they still play together. The games they play in the tree canopies and in the playhouse are not the same as when another kid join in. The games are only good when his best friends are there. 

The village is surrounded by lush green forests. The forests are a source of inspiration for the boy, his best friends, and the villagers. His mom and a local teacher teach him to paint. They see the forest in his paintings. 

After the boy graduates from the first grade, he starts middle school. There he faces a difficult decision. He must choose between his best friends, and a new path.
