        "synopsis": "It is 1943 and the Allies and Axis are engaged in a fierce World War battle across Europe. In the thick of this conflict lie the Falaise Pocket and the Saint-LÃ´ Bridges. Allied troops struggle to hold ground against a fierce Nazi onslaught while Allied bombers rain down destruction on German positions from above.",
        "beginning": "The Allied troops take some ground, but the Allies find it difficult to break free from the Axis encirclement. Their advance is aided by the Allied bombers which have the ability to strike with greater precision when flying low to the ground and close to the coast where German coastal defenses are weakest.",
        "ending": "The Allied forces eventually break out of the pocket, forcing the Nazis to retreat to the west. The Allies use the momentum from this victory to drive into the heart of German territory, eventually laying siege to occupied Paris. However, the German war machine is tenacious and the Allies are forced to retreat, suffering countless casualties in the process, while leaving behind a trail of destruction in their wake.",
