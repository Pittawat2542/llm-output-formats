Frodo, his cousin Sam, and their friend Merry set off on their journey to destroy the Ring. On their way, they encounter goblins, Nazgûl (or Flaming Rings or "dark riders"), and the Shadow, the servant of Sauron.",
        "ending": "A great battle ensues. Sam fights for his life, eventually taking the ring, which destroys the Nazgûl, but also falls down a bottomless pit. Frodo, grievously injured, is brought by Merry to the fire of a dwarf settlement. As he lies dying, he sees the Tower of Barad-dûr, where the One Ring was forged, and finally, and unbidden, the words of ancient prophecy.",
