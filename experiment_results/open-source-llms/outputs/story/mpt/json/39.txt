### The game begins in a peaceful city.
### A bright, sunny day casts an inviting atmosphere over the city. 
### However, someone, or something, is disturbing 
### the quiet.  A young man is sitting with his face in his hands, 
### sobbing, and a frightened girl is hiding 
### behind a trashcan, clutching her stomach.  Suddenly, a man is attacked 
### by a large beast outside.  He tries to run, but it chases him down and tries 
### to attack him.  As he cowers in fear, a warrior in shining armor rides 
### out of nowhere on a horse and attacks the monster.  As the man watches in amazement, the warrior battles the powerful beast and kills it.  The warrior dismounts and tells the young man to run and find help.  He immediately obeies and alerts the others as the warrior removes his helmet.  The others arrive and are shocked by his looks.  They can't believe that someone with such beauty could be so bold and courageous. 
### The warrior tells them that he was once a great warrior but an unjust betrayal caused him to become a solitary wanderer.  But after they were saved, he vowed to repay them with his life.  That was his life before the attack on the girl.
## The next day, they find the monster's nest and battle its eggs.
## The warrior saves the young man and a woman.  As a token of gratitude, she shows him around the town,
