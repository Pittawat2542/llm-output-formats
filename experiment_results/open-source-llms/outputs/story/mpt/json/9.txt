        "synopsis": "Geeks with Guns are a group of young programmers with a dream. They want to create the best game in the world. So they build their first prototype. It's a hit. Then they decide to create more games. But all their ideas are terrible, so they hire a company to build the games for them. They work hard at the company for 2 years. But the CEO decides to close the company for personal reasons. They are now bankrupt and almost homeless",
        "beginning": "They are now almost certain to fail. But the last hope is a new employee. He has a brilliant idea for them: make a game with all the features they want the most in a game. They need to sell it as a prototype first, so they start from nothing again. This time they succeed: they get investments and a staff. They sell the games in the market but it's not enough for them to live in. Their house is for sale",
        "ending": "They are now struggling with all their power. The only one that can save them is their CEO, but he is still out of their reach. Maybe they can convince the new staff to return and help them in the future? But there are still too many things to do. How can they have any time to think?"
