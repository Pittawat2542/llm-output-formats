Now humanity prepares to strike the decisive blow for the complete annihilation of the alien race. But one man, whoâ€™s long been considered a heretic among the populace, challenges the war strategy with his own plan. What would happen to the game, and to the man in the end?",
        "ending": "As the war seemed to be going according to plan, humanity's most trusted scientist formulated a plan to strike at the heart of the alien race. After some initial resistance, his plan was soon adopted by the government. This would be humanity's last chance to ensure the defeat of the alien race. But all did not go according to plan, and disaster struck.  Now, our hero is all alone. As he witnesses the annihilation of his race, his very essence slowly but surely disappears, until all that's left is ashes. And yet, an inexplicable force keeps driving him to continue... The road ahead is long, perilous, and uncertain, but it is his destiny to continue on... to defeat the un-defeatable!"
