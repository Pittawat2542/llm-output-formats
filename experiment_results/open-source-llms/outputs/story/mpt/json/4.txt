        "beginning": "Enter a world filled with creatures from Greek mythology, as a young demi-god named Zeus you will journey across a world to rescue your sister, Hera, and stop her being kidnapped by the evil God, Kronos. Zeus must navigate across the world, solve puzzles, fight against monsters and discover his powers to take on Kronos and rescue his sister.
Your story begins in Olympus where you as Zeus must train in order to get to your sister's rescue. You start on the surface as the young Zeus and receive your first lesson as his father, Kronos, tells you to get your first feather. You will then have to travel down through Hades and fight some skeletons in order to get your first feather. Next you must travel to the top of Mount Olympus where you fight against Minotaur guarding a cave, in order to get your third feather. Once you have your third feather, thatâ€™s when Zeus' first rescue begins. Hera is being lead by Hermes, the messenger, to a place called the Labyrinth. There, in a cave, you must face off against a Minotaur and some harpies until Hermes comes to rescue your sister, all the while Kronos, as the king of the monsters, is close by to stop this plan from succeeding. Once at the Labyrinth, you have to solve a few puzzles before Hermes takes his leave, leaving you to rescue your sister. You then return to Mount Olympus and begin your next rescue, to a spot called Thessalhydra. In order to defeat the monsters there, you have to solve a simple puzzle and find water in two lakes. Once you do that, you find a secret door which will return you to Mount Olympus, while Zeus's father, Kronos, is following close behind. But just as the door is closing, with the evil king of the monster breathing down Zeus's neck, a lightning storm arrives and Kronos vanishes. You and Hera are then able to make the secret, secret door, back to Mount Olympus. A new character, Athena, appears in front of you as the guardian of the secret door, and tells you she will be your teacher, and now tells you that Kronos will one day be your next student. This begins Kronos' Story. The last few scenes, if you take the route of being a good student, allow you to use your powers to start a storm, which causes a rock to fall, crushing Kronos. Once it is crushed, Kronos, as a baby, is then returned to the underworld."
