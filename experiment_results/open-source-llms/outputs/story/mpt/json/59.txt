Here is an example of a synopsis for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild:

As a young boy, Link journeys to the far reaches of the kingdom to gather the legendary Heroâ€™s Sword, which is sought by dangerous monsters who threaten peace in the kingdom. After Link defeats the monsters, he gathers the sword and returns to his village. Years later, as a young man, Link is called to the same area to investigate strange occurrences. He discovers the king and many other villagers missing, and is kidnapped by the Gannon, an evil force which is controlling the monsters from the past. Link must now find a way to free the king and destroy the Gannon.
