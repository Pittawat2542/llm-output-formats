The world is yours for the taking as an elite commando. From the jungles of Madagascar to the skies over the Falkland Isles, you are there to complete the mission and return home a hero. But can you accomplish it under fire, with your team relying on you? 
Set in the Falklands War, Commando takes you from desert island to urban warfare as you take on multiple missions across the Falklands, fighting for your life, friends, and freedom. The immersive storytelling puts you in the boots of a soldier.
As a member of a special forces unit, you’ll carry out a range of tactical operations in the most realistic environments. You could be sent to raid a farm or a prison, track down enemy communications or even conduct a daring extraction. As each scenario unfolds, you’ll have to evaluate your next move and use everything at your disposal – from air support to weapons, gear, and the battlefield around you.
