        "synopsis": "Here’s a short story from a game I’ve just completed called <Game>. It’s a dark fantasy game in which you play as a priest seeking to save the world. The world in this game is actually only a large and extremely dangerous continent, so exploring it (and dealing with its inhabitants) makes up the vast majority of the gameplay. After a brief introductuon to the world and some of the major characters in the game, you begin your quest by meeting an old friend who hires you to perform a sacred ritual for them. Soon after this, you are confronted by a powerful enemy and a key plot point of the game is triggered. From here, it’s basically just your standard hack’n'slash gameplay; exploring environments, fighting monsters, collecting treasure, and so on. As you progress through the game, you discover more about the world and its history, and uncover many of the secrets that were hidden from you. Eventually, you fight the final battle and save the world! Overall, this was a really good game and I’d definitely recommend it; it was a fairly long game as well, lasting close to 40 hours so it would probably be best played in shorter bouts. The only real downside was that the gameplay was essentially identical for most of the game, and it wasn’t particularly challenging or interesting. Still, overall it was a great experience and the game was nicely paced with a nice balance of action, exploration, and storytelling.",
