There once was a boy. He was born to a normal family in a normal town. Nothing remarkable about him, except that he was special. His father found him a perfect place to grow up, and he developed into a normal boy, going to a normal school, and making friends in his normal neighborhood.

But the boy's mind was very different from everyone else who went to school. He found himself with powers beyond what any human should have. The boy was the last of a race of people called "the ones", and his mind was still strong in the ways of his parents' people, but he had to learn from the ways of his own.

One day, the boy got a visit from a teacher and his friends, and they told him an impossible thing. But what he heard made sense, and it was the moment of truth. It was the story of the boy, who was now a man and a member of a secret group fighting the evil that threatened his world.

It was the story of the man, who was searching for a destiny to fulfill that was long overdue. It was a promise that was finally fulfilled, and the world that he was a part of, and the boy he was before, would forever be a new world for him to build again.

Now, the boy became the man. He was a part of a secret society, and with the help of his friends, he would save the world. He would use the powers that he had never known he had, and the ones who saw his destiny before him would be part of this new world he would save.

The boy had a destiny to fulfill. The boy became the man. He was the one that all the people in the world hoped would stand up for them and fight the evil that had been consuming them. He was the one that would save them, and he would save the world.

That was the story of the man, and the boy who became the man. This was the story of the man who saved the world, and the boy who would be the man.
