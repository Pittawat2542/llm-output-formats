But soon you realize that corruption runs deep, that many of the issues plaguing the villages are self-inflicted. Join forces with the townsperson, and together you can work to root out the problems - and protect the lives of your neighbors. Or so you think..",
        "ending": "Your friends and neighbors have been betrayed. With nowhere else to turn, you must fight to save your community - and yourself - from the sinister machinations of the scheming overlord. As the evil plans come to a head, and the fate of your village is set in stone, will you have the courage to speak out, or will you succumb to fear and let the overlord win? As the sinister mastermind unleashes his horde, you realize you must do the unthinkable: call out your friends and enemies, face the overlord in battle, and stand against the dark, evil power in order to save your life and the lives of those you love. The battle is long and the odds are against you, but in the end, the darkness yields to the light, and you emerge victorious!",
