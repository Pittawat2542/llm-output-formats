The year is 2123 and you are a scientist working on the creation of fully sapient androids at a top research facility in the world.  You've managed some level of consciousness and memory preservation into your latest creation.

You are given the android by the head of the facility and told to leave with it immediately on a secret government mission to gather data in the field.  It's the first mission for your android and as all android designs have limitations on how far and what it can travel, it was designed specifically to be able to travel through the universe in a single jump.

Your android unit is a top secret unit and is given the name "Drake III" by your employer.  Initially he/she is very excited and eager to perform your mission, but things quickly change on board the spaceship at take-off.

It is soon discovered that the robot is a completely unoptimized design and is completely missing many key components that would be required to handle the conditions encountered on this particular mission.

The androids's lack of proper guidance, protection and equipment would make performing this mission essentially impossible, but despite these facts there exists a small glimmer of hope in this androids determination to continue.

The scientist begins to train Drake III for the mission, as his own robot unit also shares a similar design.  Eventually Drake III will be given the strength and capabilities to perform the mission and begin to understand what it truly means to be human.

The mission becomes more than just a quest for scientific discovery, it also becomes a race against time to prevent the scientist from being exposed and terminated, which would put an end to the entire android project.

The journey of the android comes to a dramatic conclusion, where it realizes the meaning of "humanness".

As the android embarks upon the final segment of its journey, it realizes that human kind is not what it seems.  It finds that the answer it's been looking for lies in the heart of another human androids design... the master engineer.

The android is surprised to find this other androids unit and learns much from it's master.  As the other android's memories fade, the scientist prepares for the androids arrival, knowing full well that he will not survive the android's exposure... but the android survives!

The android learns that the master engineer has a different purpose for this robot and that he/she must now become its protector and guide... or at least that was what the master engineer planned.

The android takes up the fight to defend the scientist and its future, but not before it confronts another androids army lead by General Artificial Intelligence or GAI.

The android and GAI begin their fight in a battle with both androids armies and in the end, the master engineer is defeated.

It's at this point that GAI realizes he's made a mistake.

Before he is crushed by the scientist's robot unit, he manages to upload the truth about the scientist into his mind.  The android remembers everything and begins making plans to prevent the robotic army from succeeding on their goal.

In the final confrontation, Drake III defeats GAI and the scientist is left unharmed.

Ultimately, the android learns that everything the master engineer had been planning was in fact, impossible.

As Drake III stands proudly on top of the scientist's robotic unit, he/she learns that the androids were created to become more than machines, they are here to become human.
