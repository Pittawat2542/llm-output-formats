You are the new farmer of your family farm in the small town of Greenfield! Help your grandfather run this new farm, and help out your grandma while she runs the general store! The town has some bad luck though, its crops are suffering from a mysterious ailment and they need you to get to the bottom of it!

As you walk through town you notice there is a lot of gossip. Some of the townspeople suspect that the new store, run by your grandparents, is the source of the strange ailment. 
The townspeople all believe the worst of your family because of the reputation your family had in the past.  They need you to get rid of the rumors, and restore the family name. 

You soon discover that the strange illness is spreading through the crops, and it's also making animals behave strangely.  The more you talk with the animals, the more you realize that they were all behaving strangely before you showed up.

So now you have to convince the townspeople that the Sherrif is wrong, and figure out why the crops are sick!  Can you find out what is happening before they destroy your family farm?
