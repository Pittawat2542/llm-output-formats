        "synopsis": "A young boy and his grandfather journey through a lost world of dinosaurs and mystery to find the legendary lost tail and prove the grandfather's legacy.",
        "beginning": "One beautiful morning in November, the grandfather sat the young boy down on the living room couch. He said, 'I've got something very exciting to tell you. We're headed on a trip to the badlands!' The young boy's eyes lit up. Grandfathers' tales were always the best. 'The badlands?' the young boy said, trying to look nonchalant. 'We're going to an actual place that's really bad?' 'No, no', the grandfather assured his grandson. 'The badlands are a special place, in all the world; they are a natural place of wonder and wild magic."',
        "ending": "...and the young boy sat proudly by his grandfather as they were welcomed by the great dinosaurs of the park. 'It's beautiful!" the young boy exclaimed, running to embrace a stegosaurus. 'My son I am proud to show you this wonderful place', the grandfather said. And with that, he took the young boy's hands and led him through the park, showing him the wonders of the great beast.
