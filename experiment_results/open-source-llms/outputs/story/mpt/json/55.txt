The world was a vast place, unexplored and full of possibilities. But she was stuck: trapped between a burning building and a horde of bloodthirsty mobs. With her last bit of strength, she ran for the city gates, trying to escape to safety. But it was too late. She tripped in her haste and was trampled by a passing chariot. A horrible roar echoed through the city, and all was still as the smoke cleared. One survivor.

The end.
