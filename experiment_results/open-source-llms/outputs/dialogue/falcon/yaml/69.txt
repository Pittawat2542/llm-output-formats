<h4>YAML code block</h4>
```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: name (optional)
      text: "dialogue content"

```

Explanation:
- `game`: The root element of the Markdown file.
- `dialogues`: A list of dialogue objects in the Markdown code block.
- `order`: Specifies the order in which the dialogues should be placed in the output. If there is no specific ordering, the index of each dialogue in the list will be considered as the ordering index.
- `speaker`: The name of the speaker in the dialogue.
- `text`: The text of the dialogues, or any other Markdown syntax enclosed between two triple brackets.

In the example YAML, `dialogues` is a list of dialogue objects enclosed in a list with the tag `game.html`. Each dialogue in the YAML list has text enclosed between two double quotes and a single Markdown syntax inside the single quotes.
