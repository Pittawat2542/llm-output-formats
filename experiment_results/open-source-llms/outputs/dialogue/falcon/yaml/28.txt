Generated output:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: Dialogue order
    speaker: Speaker name
    text: Dialogue or narration
    onscreen: True
    duration: [hours] # Optional, but can help ensure a more structured output
    description: "" # Optional, but good YAML practice to describe a feature or function
```

In the above example, we've included an optional `onscreen` key with `True` value to indicate if the game is being broadcast or performed live. We've also included a `duration` key with a `hours` type and empty value to indicate the duration of the game, but you can include other units or types if needed.
