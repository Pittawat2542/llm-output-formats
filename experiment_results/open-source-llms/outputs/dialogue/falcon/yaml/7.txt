# Excerpt extracted from Markdown code block
# with only YAML tags and surrounding
// tags marked
```

speaker:
  name: <name>
  text: <text>
order:
- name: <name>
```

In the code block, the YAML tags are wrapped inside `//` tags. The `order` tag and `speaker` tag are defined separately using specific YAML tags. The `dialogue` tag is then wrapped around all the YAML tags inside the code. The enclosed YAML tags with the `name`: `speaker` tag have a single parent tag which separates them from surrounding tags and makes them stand out.
