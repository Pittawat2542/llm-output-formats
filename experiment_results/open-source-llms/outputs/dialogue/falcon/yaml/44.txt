# Markdown code-block
* Return the block of content in the desired chatbot language, (e.g.). The text inside the `markdown` tag is the same as the YAML code block. You are here. * In the YAML file, the word "speaker" is underlined so we can map it to the appropriate text formatting. Note that `text` is set to a `markdown` tag so it can be rendered inside the chatbot.
