```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text: dialogue or narration
```
```yaml
speak:
```yaml
- message_text: dialogue text
```

Explanation:

  - The code block generates Markdown to output YAML using list items. The `# Output format` syntax block creates a table with the `game` and `dialogues` keys specifying that this is an table within a table. The `order` key specifies the order in which the speakers appeared in the dialogue. The `speaker` key specifies the name of the speaker. Lastly, all content in the `dialogue` and `text` keys are wrapped in Markdown syntax using YAML to render them as table rows.
