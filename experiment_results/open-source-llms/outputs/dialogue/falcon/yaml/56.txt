Can you provide an example of when the Markdown code block should be used and when Notepad+Code blocks should be considered?</s> 
Notepad+Code blocks are not necessary for Markdown as it already has the option to embed text. Markdown can be used for structured text, such as code blocks, tables, and lists, while Notepad+Code blocks should be used to embed programmatically generated content or non-structured text to the wiki page. Notepad+Code blocks can cause formatting and display issues, and are often used for more technical or technical documentation.
