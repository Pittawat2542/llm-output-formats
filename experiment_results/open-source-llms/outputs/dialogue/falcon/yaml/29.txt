# Markdown code block
### YAML Output
```

Here is the desired output in YAML format with only the YAML in the Markdown code block:
```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text:
      type: quote quote
        quote: "Dialogue. And I quote a quote."
```

In the YAML, the "order" field contains the speaker's name. The "speaker" field contains the name of the speaker (which will be replaced with the correct value later). The "text" field contains a Markdown block that will be replaced with a quote attributed to the speaker. The quote will contain the text of the quote.
