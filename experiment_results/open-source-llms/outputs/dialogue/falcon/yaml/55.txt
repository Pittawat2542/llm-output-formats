```yaml
Speaker: John   
Text: I am learning a new skill!
```

In this code block, we generate two Markdown YAML files. The first file defines the Markdown structure for a dialogue in the game, including the speakers involved, their order, and the text of the dialogue.

The second file defines a Markdown structure for a single sentence, which will act as the text for a single dialogue. The text is `Speaker` and `Text` in this case.
