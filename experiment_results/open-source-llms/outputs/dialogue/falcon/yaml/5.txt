In this YAML, we have a list of `YAML` objects named `dialogues`, where each dialogue is an `Order` object with a `speaker` property, a `text` property, and an `order` property that determines the order of the dialogue. The `text` property is a string representing the dialogue or narration, which is enclosed in speech marks to mark a pause for each speaker or sentence (`|`).

We nest a set of `YAML` objects in the `game` object, where each object represents a group of dialogues that are related to the same topic, such as a series of events in a game. Inside each dialogue, we define the `speaker`, the text, and the order of the dialogue.
