{
  "game": {
    "dialogues": {},
    "speaker": "speaker name",
    "text": "dialogue or narration"
  }
}
```

In this example, the `game` section contains a `dialogues` key, which is an ordered list of dialogue objects within the section. Within each dialogue, there is a `speaker` key that specifies who is speaking and a `text` key that contains the text of their dialogue. To avoid rendering non-YAML content in YAML format, any other key inside the dialogue block will have a default value of `""`.
