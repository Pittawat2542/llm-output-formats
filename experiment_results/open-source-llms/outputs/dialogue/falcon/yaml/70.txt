The dialogue can be replaced with a YAML block that contains a single "game" object, which contains a "dialogue" object with "speaker" and "text" keys. The speakers can be specified using double backslashes ("").
```

  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: User
    - key: text
      text: "I heard that we needed to hurry up."
