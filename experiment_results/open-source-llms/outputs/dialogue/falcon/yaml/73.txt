Explanation:
- The Markdown code block is output as YAML format, with `#` comments indicating it is a YAML block.
- The YAML has the appropriate keys for each element, including parentheses and quotes for blockquotes. The `order` element is wrapped in parentheses to maintain its position.
- The `text` and `speaker` elements are kept together as part of the player's dialogue. They are enclosed in separate dialogues to maintain consistency with the key format.
