In this example, the "```xml" code is wrapped in a specific section that uses the "text" Markdown syntax. The output is a well-formed XML document that only contains the Markdown code block and a single game object. The Markdown code block is wrapped in a specific section with the "dialogues" tag. Within this tag, a "speaker" tag is used to specify the name of the person speaking in the dialogue, and a "text" tag is used to indicate the words of a specific quote within the dialogue.
