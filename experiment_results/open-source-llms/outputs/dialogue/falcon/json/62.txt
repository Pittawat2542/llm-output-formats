```JSON
{
   "game": {
      "dialogues": [
         {
           "order": "dialogue order",
           "speaker": "speaker name",
           "text": "dialogue or narration"
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

The `{game.dialogues []` syntax within brackets ensures that all dialogue arrays in the `JSON` are nested inside each other, allowing for the output to be wrapped in the desired result.
