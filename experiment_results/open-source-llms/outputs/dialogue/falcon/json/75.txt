### Output ###

{
    "game": {
        "dialogues": [{
            "order": "dialogue order",
            "speaker": "speaker name",
            "text": "Dialogue or narration"
        }]
    }
}
```

In the JSON output, the `game` object has an array of dialogue objects. Inside each dialogue object, the `"order"` property contains the order of dialogue elements, and the `"speaker"` property contains the name of the speaker. The `"text"` property contains the text of the dialogue or narration.
