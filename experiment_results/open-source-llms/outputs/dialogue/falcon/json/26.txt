<pre><code>{
   "game": {
       "dialogues": [{
           "order": "dialogue order",
           "speaker": "speaker name",
           "text": "dialogue or narration"
       }]
   }
}
</code></pre>

In this example, the text inside of the "game" structure is in JSON format. The "# Output format" inside of the Markdown code block is interpreted as a JSON string and printed directly to the screen.

In the JSON, any inner properties or items are represented in square brackets ([]) as JSON objects or arrays. The structure of the JSON is:

- "game": a JSON object containing a collection of conversation objects.
- "dialogues": a nested array of conversation objects.
- "order": the index of the speaker in the order of dialogues.
- "speaker": the name of the speaker.
- "text": the actual dialogue or narration.
