```json
{
   "game": {
      "dialogue": [{
         "dialogues": [{
           "order": "dialogue order",ï¿½
           "speaker": {
               "name": "speaker name"
            },
           "text": "dialogue or narration"
         }
      }
     }]
}
``` 

In the first example, we wrapped the JSON in a backticks (`) to create a formatted JSON. Since the JSON is inside curly braces (`{}`), we can't return it directly. However, we can escape the JSON from the Markdown code block using a template string and JSON.stringify() to create a formatted JSON output in the terminal. 

In the second example, we use the JSON property to format the key using backticks inside the JSON. Since the JSON is also inside curly braces, we can't return it directly.
