Dialogue

- "Game dialogues are like real conversations filled with information and jokes."
- "In real life, they fill you in on people, your favorite band, and other things."
- "Of course, you don't just say anything to anyone, as you'd run the risk of getting a few unwanted words in your ears."
- "You can't just keep talking without getting to know each other first."
- "Dialogue is as much about listening as talking."
- "It's true that once you do start talking, the conversation moves quickly."
- "In this sense, dialogues are an underrated form of learning."
- "Dialogue requires active listening, not just a way to fill in silences."
- "It's one thing to actively listen to your partner, but it's quite another to make them feel comfortable."
- "Sometimes it takes a few exchanges, before dialogues get to the heart of the matter."
- "Dialogue is like a conversation with the stranger on the train."
- "But most of all, it's about finding out why we're even having the conversation in the first place."
- "In the end, it doesn't matter who you're talking to, it's always the same."
- "It's just two people catching up with each other, swapping stories and ideas."
