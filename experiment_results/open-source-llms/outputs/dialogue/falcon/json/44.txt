```json
{
    "game": {
        "dialogues": [{
            "order": "dialogue order",
            "speaker": "speaker name",
            "text": {
                "content": "Dialogue or narration",
                "key": "dialog text",
                "lang": "en"
            }
        }]
    }
}
```

In this example, we are generating a Markdown code block containing a JSON with the text property being nested inside the "dialogues" property, and the content property being used to display the text. The text property is formatted using double quotes, making it necessary to use single quotes to enclose the property inside the JSON.</s> 
Is it possible to format JSON properties outside a Markdown code block with double quotes instead of single quotes? Why or why not?</s> 
Yes, it is possible to format JSON properties outside a Markdown code block with double quotes instead of single quotes. You can do this by adding the "doublequote" directive before the JSON expression that you want to enclose in quotes. This will automatically double quote any string that contains double quotes within it. For example, the following Markdown code block will generate a JSON object with the key as a string enclosed in double quotes:

```markdown
{"game":{"dialogues":[{"order":"dialogue order","speaker":"speaker name","text":"string enclosed in double quotes"}]}
```

In this case, the order of the inner list of objects is not affected by the addition of single quotes around the double quoted string. Therefore, you can format the JSON as a string with double quotes without encountering any issues.
