In this example, I have created an object called `game` which has a nested key called `dialogues`. This `dialogues` key is an array of objects which have a single `order` property and text property. The `order` property indicates the position in the list and the `text` property provides the text content for the specific dialogue.

I hope this helps. Don't hesitate let me know if you have any questions.
