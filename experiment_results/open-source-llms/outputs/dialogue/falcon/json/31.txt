```
[
    {{ dialogue.dialogues | map('game.1') | jsonify() | trim() | jsonify() } =&gt; game.1.speaker
],
[
    {{ dialogue.dialogues | map('game.2') | jsonify() | trim() | jsonify() } =&gt; game.2.speaker
]
```

In this example, 'order' and'speaker' keys define an array within 'dialogues'. The 'game.1' and 'game.2' keys are JSON objects within these arrays. 'order' is an array that represents the order in which the dialogue was selected on the page, and'speaker' is a speaker that represents the person speaking within the dialogue.
