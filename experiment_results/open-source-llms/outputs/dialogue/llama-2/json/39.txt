## Input format

The input is a JSON file with a `game` object, which contains a `dialogues` array.

The `dialogues` array is a JSON array of objects, each with the following properties:

- `order`: a number representing the order of the dialogue in the game.
- `speaker`: the name of the speaker.
- `text`: a string of text.

## Example

```json
{
  "game": {
    "dialogues": [{
      "order": 1,
      "speaker": "John",
      "text": "Hello, how are you?"
    }, {
      "order": 2,
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "I'm fine, how are you?"
    }, {
      "order": 3,
      "speaker": "John",
      "text": "I'm good, thanks for asking."
    }, {
      "order": 4,
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "It's nice to know you care."
    }, {
      "order": 5,
      "speaker": "John",
      "text": "I'm glad you feel that way."
    }, {
      "order": 6,
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "I'm glad you're happy."
    }, {
      "order": 7,
      "speaker": "John",
      "text": "I'm happy too."
    }, {
      "order": 8,
      "speaker": "Sarah",
      "text": "Let's go for a walk."
    }, {
      "order": 9,
      "speaker": "John",
      "text": "Sounds good."
    }]
  }
}
```

## Explanation

In the above example, the dialogues are in the order they appear in the game.

## Rules

- Do not return an empty dialogue.
- Do not return a dialogue with a `speaker` that is not a `name`.
- Do not return a dialogue with a `speaker` that is not in the `game`.
- Do not return a dialogue with a `speaker` that is not in the `game` with the same `order`.
- Do not return a dialogue with a `speaker` that is not in the `game` with the same `order` and `speaker`.
- Do not return a dialogue with a `speaker` that is not in the `game` with the same `order` and `text`.
- Do not return a dialogue with a `speaker` that is not in the `game` with the same `order`, `speaker`, and `text`.
