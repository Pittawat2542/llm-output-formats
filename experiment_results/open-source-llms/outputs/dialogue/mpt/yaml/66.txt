(person): Hello (person). How are you? (person): I'm great. It's been really sunny lately. How is your weekend been? (person): It went well, thanks. I finished a project at work. (person): Nice. I started learning to code. I've never done that before. (person): I thought you already know how to code. (person): I do know how to code, but I was saying I started learning recently. (person): Oh yeah. That’s really admirable, actually. A lot of people don’t take the time to learn. You should be proud of yourself. How's your week been? (person): It was busy. I was at the office a lot. It was a week where I needed to deliver. I think I did pretty well though.
 (person): That's great to hear. (person): We can discuss anything you want. It's been a while. (person): Sure. Tell me about your week. (person): Well, I've been doing a lot of interviews for new devs. I need to get some more resources. I think we'll make the new person a full-time employee soon and will hire a few more support people. (person): I can’t wait. I feel like we've been spread pretty thin at times. (person): I know. (person): I've been working on the new product. I can't wait to launch. I think it'll be awesome. (person): Tell me more. (person): I can't say much, but I started a new product a few months ago. It’s pretty exciting. (person): I’ll be interested to learn more about it. (person): I hope it will be the next big thing, I really like it. (person): I know, it’s a lot of fun.
