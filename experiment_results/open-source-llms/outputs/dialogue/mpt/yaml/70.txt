Okay, I think this is a good dialogue:

Game Master: Hey everyone! Welcome to another fabulous adventure! I have two choices for you this time:

Player 1: Please, tell us more about the situation, so that we know what to expect.

Game Master: That sounds like a good idea! Well, the previous adventure didn’t go so well, and the kingdom is in a bit of a state. To help out, the King has enlisted the aid of a magic genie, as you know, to grant three wishes. The genie told the king he has one wish left, and that it’s his last chance to make something of his life. We don’t know what the king wishes for yet, but we do know what he wants to “make something of his life,” and he’s willing to make a very risky wager.

Player 2: What risk does he want to make?

Game Master: Well, as a last resort, he will release an entire army of zombie cats into the kingdom in hopes that they will help him take down the dragon.

Player 3: The royal dragon has been terrorizing the kingdom.

Player 4: So we're going to the kingdom to take down the dragon. How?

Game Master: The king is willing to bet that all the cats in the kingdom will join in and kill the dragon.

Game Master: The king will get his wish if the cat army kills the dragon, but if it fails then the king will have to face his zombie cats!

Player 1: You know that some of us have pets. Should we be worried about what would become of our cats?

Game Master: You should each make your own decisions, but I’d like to share some research I’ve found. Apparently, if the cat has a good owner, they are quite unlikely to turn into a zombie cat and attack. There is also this article on how to avoid becoming a zombie cat. That said, let’s keep this information in mind; we’ll have to choose between the king’s “plan” of releasing the zombie cats, and our own “plan” of facing our fears and trying to take down the dragon ourselves.

Player 2: Well, I’m not a fan of cats, so I don’t want to risk being near a zombie cat. But I’ll try to do my best to beat the dragon.

Player 3: I’d like to help the king with his plan. I’ll need to prepare, but I think I can get the cats to help. But if the plan fails, I’ll become a zombie cat.

Player 4: I want to help the king as well. I’ll train with him and help the cats. But if the plan fails, I’ll have to kill the cats.

Player 5: I don’t care too much about killing the dragon, but I don’t want to risk the cats or becoming a zombie cat.

Game Master: Okay! So the players in this game are (in order): Player 1, who doesn’t care too much, Player 2 who wants to try to beat the dragon, Player 3, who wants to help the king, and Player 4, who wants to beat the dragon and help the king. Each player has chosen a specific course of action in response to this dialogue. The game can proceed from here!
