"It's a beautiful day today," Sally said looking out of the window. "I'd love to go outside. May I go out to play for a little while?"
"Sure, you are a good kid, you know that?" Her father replied.
"Yes, I know."
"I don't know if you'll like the neighbors' dog, but you can come out and play with it if you want."
"You think I'd like it?"
"Well, you are a young kid now, so that doesn't mean much, but yes I do."
"Okay, fine. I'll come out to play with their dog."
"But I'll be back before you get too tired. So take care and have a great time!" Dad waved, and Sally went outside to play.

She immediately started talking with the neighbours' dog, asking about his name and if he had a nice day. After they came out to play for a bit, the dog got tired and went back to the house, and Sally went home from there.
