“But if we leave now it’ll be dangerous to walk in the forest during the day!”, “I don’t mind walking in the forest during the day, and you can keep up with me!”, “Fine, but be ready to run back to the house if we get attacked! I’ll keep the walkie talkie around my neck in case of emergency!”, “Oh, right, sure. I guess we should hurry then. Come on!”
