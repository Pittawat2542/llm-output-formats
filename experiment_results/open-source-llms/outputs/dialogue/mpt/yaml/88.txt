The game master will play through a turn-based dialogue with the player, taking a turn per player action. They'll alternate turns until the game ends. The player's actions will have no effect on the world for now, and it's the GM's job to drive the story and game experience with their dialogue choices. When it's the GM's turn, they'll reply to the player's text with one of their own. After the last dialog is complete, the game will end. The rules for play have been published on the internet and will be included with the game as a.pdf document.
