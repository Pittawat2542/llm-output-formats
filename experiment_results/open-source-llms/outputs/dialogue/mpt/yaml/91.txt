Game developers are often faced with the challenge of generating dialogue between two or more NPCs in the course of writing video game scripts. Dialogue is most often generated procedurally, and the NPCs will naturally react to each other based on choices from the player, actions from the players character, and other mechanics that are built into the game world. This often results in dialogue that is stiff and uninspiring. The ideal solution is to have a system in place that can write dialogue that feels more human and interesting. I believe a deep learning model could generate this type of dialogue with very little overhead and could be used as a tool in the creative pipeline of game developers to produce more interesting and fluid NPC dialogues.
