# Example:

Hey there! You look like someone who could help me!

Hi, friend! I can try.

Oh, I need your help on my report. I'm running out of time and I can't seem to understand this part.

Sure! I can have a look, but I also have a feeling you will also have to do some work here.

Wow, that's a big part. In your head, could you describe to me what you have written so far?

I will try. The idea is that I have to describe the following example to you

A story about a journey of a little mouse. It starts on a windy day; the little mouse sets out from its home with a jar of milk and a small spoon of sugar in its small rucksack. On the way, he meets many friends: a sheep, an elephant, and a squirrel, among many others. The little mouse arrives at a beautiful place; however, he realizes he does not know how to pay for his stay there. He walks into the inn, where a lady mouse with sparkling eyes and silky hair welcomes him. The little mouse then discovers that this lady mouse was actually the owner of the inn.

“So, this is what you have written so far,” I state to my friend.
“Hmm, yes. Here is a part of the tale about the little mouse: He was born the best mouse ever. However, when the little mouse returned home, he realized that he had brought more milk than necessary, and for some reason, not even the smallest mouse in the village seemed interested in his gift. And the mouse thought to himself 'it's so hard to be born as the best mouse ever. And no one even notices my gift'.”
