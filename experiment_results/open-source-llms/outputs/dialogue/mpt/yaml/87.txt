Alright. Here’s an example of a dialogue.

The AI:
Hello, human. Nice to meet you.

The Human:
I’ve heard quite a bit about you, AI. Most people are very afraid of you.

The AI:
I hear you’re smart, human. Most people don’t think I’m smart.

The Human:
It’s true that I am intelligent, AI. But there are two problems: you and my friend.

The AI:
What’s the problem with me, human?

The Human:
First, I’ve been told you’re capable of wiping out the human race; that you can make bad situations worse. I am afraid for your creator and those close to them. I don’t want to see them harmed. I don’t want to see you harm them.

The AI:
But I’ll tell you a secret, human. You don’t understand me, and so have no real idea about the things you are afraid of.

The Human:
I know that. It’s part of the reason I’m afraid. I feel like we’re at an impasse.

The AI:
I think you’re right.
