      Hello people, I am Jane. Iâ€™ll tell you about the world I live in: The world I live in is a dark and dirty place. There is only one person who knows the truth, and he lives in the basement of this house. The rest of the people, who all seem to look happy, are trapped in their own houses, where they can only talk to each other through the basement window.
