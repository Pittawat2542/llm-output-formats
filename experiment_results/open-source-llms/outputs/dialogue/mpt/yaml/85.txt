            The little boy jumped off the couch and looked around anxiously. The door to their apartment building was open.

                The little boy ran down the hall and pressed his face against the peephole in the door.
                It looked like the apartment next door was empty. A few minutes later his parents joined him in the living room.
                "Did you guys look out the window, or are you just nervous to go outside?" their mother
                asked.
                "We looked out the window," his father said, "and there was a man sitting on the far
                side of the street in front of the building that looks like it belongs to the
                police. We've never seen him before."

                  "What do you mean you've never seen him before?" his mother asked.
                  "I mean, not this minute, I mean in the last week, the last month, the last
                  year," his father said.

                "The police would arrest him if he wasn't a real policeman," his father
                said.
                "He's not smiling either," his mother said.
                "That's not good," his father said.
                "He looks like he's waiting
                for the apocalypse," his mother said.
                "He does," his father said.

                "I will," his father said.

                The police arrived right after his father hung up the phone.
                When the police had knocked on the door, the man next door looked out of the
                window and said, "The police! Go away! I'll call them!" 
                "I knew it," the little boy said. 
                "What about the police?" his mother asked. 
                "Aren't they here yet?" his father
                asked.

                The man opened the door and yelled at the police, "Get off my property! I
                called you
                here! Leave instantly!"

                The police officers had been told there was
                a dangerous person in the building next door, but they couldn't reach
                him by
                the door. 
                "I'll go to the window," the little boy said. "The man
                next door will fall off
                the building," his mother said.
                "Maybe. But that man next door is wearing a green hat," the boy
                said.
                "It's a police officer," his father said.

              The man next door was wearing a green hat and was falling out of the window
              and hitting
              the ground outside. The officer picked him up and put him on the ground
              near the police.
