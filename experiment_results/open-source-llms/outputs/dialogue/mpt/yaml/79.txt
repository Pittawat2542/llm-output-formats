First Speakers is a computer program created by Dr. E.R. Bradbury in 1945, to communicate with other computer programmers. It has been updated and expanded over the years and now contains many languages used to create computer programs, software and video games. Some of these are C/C++, Java, Python, Rust, Swift, Assembly, VB.NET, HTML, CSS and Ruby. First Speakers and many similar programs are often referred to as an Artificial Intelligence system, or even as an AI assistant. AIs can simulate conversation with users without having a person directly giving input. This allows for faster and more convenient communication between humans and AI programs. They can also act as assistants, performing repetitive tasks for humans that are simple and easy to do with the help of a computer.
