    text: This house has been on the market for weeks. Maybe it will sell soon.
  - order: 2
    speaker: Frank
    text: It’s certainly in nice condition, and we’re pleased with the price. The only disadvantage is that it’s fairly isolated.
  - order: 3
    speaker: Mike
    text: That is unfortunate. We’d really need to be near public transportation in that case.
  - order: 4
    speaker: Alice
    text: Actually there is a bus that goes near here, it’s just somewhat infrequent.
  - order: 5
    speaker: Mike
    text: It’s not ideal, but there’s a trade off for sure.
  - order: 6
    speaker: Frank
    text: Well, how about we make an offer.
  - order: 7
    speaker: Alice
    text: That was easy!
