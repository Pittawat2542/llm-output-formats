Here's an example dialogue:

“Ah, you’re here to see the fish, aren’t you?” The shopkeeper had a smile as broad as the entrance. She was a small woman in a brown dress and a blue apron, with dark hair that was pulled back in a bun.

“They aren't allowed in here,” Marcus said to me.

“Oh, yes they are, I’ve seen them here before,” the shopkeeper said cheerfully. She was looking at me, and I had a sudden vision of someone watching me, carefully studying me.

“You can’t bring them in here,” Marcus replied, frowning.

“They were just here a few moments ago! Look, over by the fish tank, there they are.” She moved her hand, and a dozen or so transparent fish swam away from the other side of the tank, circling back to the corner of the store. The little fish swam over to the edge of the tank, then headed back to the middle.

“Let me see,” I said. I pulled Marcus into the shop, then moved alongside the storekeeper. “I’ve never seen them before, no.”

“Hmm, that’s strange,” the shopkeeper said, as the transparent fish swirled slowly around the edge of the tank, circling back to the middle, then going back to the rim.

“I... don’t think I understand,” I said.

“Oh, these are the most beautiful fish, but they don’t have gills, so they can’t breathe in here,” the shopkeeper said. “The tank has filters that replace the water, a bit at a time, and keep the fish alive in here, but the filter only works by moving water, so the fish can only stay as long as the tank’s supply of water lasts. The rest of the time they’re floating around in the air, until enough fresh water is delivered to the tank.”

“Oh, that’s fascinating,” I said, as the rest of the fish swam back to the middle of the tank, then slowly circled back to the rim. “I never knew that fish could live out of water.”

“I guess most don't, but certain ones can.” The shopkeeper waved her hand and a few of the fish drifted to another part of the store, then glided to the tanks and disappeared. “They spend most of their lives out of the water,” the shopkeeper said, “and just float in a kind of air that’s trapped inside the store. But I have some other kinds of fish that need to be in water, so I put the air-breathing fish in their tanks, and use a hose to fill their tanks.”

“This is... very interesting,” I said. I turned to Marcus. “I had no idea there were fish like that. That is fascinating.” I looked back at the shopkeeper.

“I know it’s odd,” she said, “but I like seeing them swim around here.” She moved her hand, and the fish disappeared, then reappeared a few meters away.

“I’d like to see a few of them swim around here,” Marcus said.

“Oh, sure, here they are!” she said, waving. Another dozen transparent fish circled to the middle of the tank, then swam back to the rim.

“That’s really neat,” Marcus said.
