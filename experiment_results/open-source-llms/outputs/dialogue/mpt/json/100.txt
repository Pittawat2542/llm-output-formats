It was Jedi master's expectation that Annie, his student, would demonstrate all the saber fighting moves that she had learned so far, and be ready when he demanded it. Annie, who had been working very hard on her saber combat skills and wanted to be considered a real Jedi in the master's eyes, was very happy to have received this opportunity. The master did not want to waste this opportunity to motivate and prepare Annie, and he had used strong positive motivation to ensure that Annie would perform well and to make her feel valued and important.
