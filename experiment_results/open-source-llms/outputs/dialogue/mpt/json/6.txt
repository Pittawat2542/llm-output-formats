"This is a sample dialogue script generated via a custom machine learning model."

"As such, the output should only ever be used as an example. It is not the output you should expect."

"Please see the documentation section on the website for more details."

"It is possible that the model will generate undesirable output, or even output that could be considered harmful, due to the limits of the data it was trained on."

"If you do choose to use this generator, take a copy of the generated text and check it over yourself."

"You can customize the output by training the model on different datasets, which you can generate via https://www.yourdomain.com"

"Please be especially careful if you run this model on sensitive data."

"If you train your model on the English Wikipedia, please note that the output will likely contain swear words."

"You can avoid this by filtering content."

"When filtering text, there are certain patterns that will be eliminated, so please
avoid filtering content that contains essential information or that is important to show accurately, for example, such as names of people, places, and things, or legal or financial information."

"This script is intended for educational purposes only, and should not be used for any other purposes."

"If we determine that you are abusing this model or are otherwise using it
wrongfully, we will notify the appropriate party and take actions."

"This is the text that will be outputted by the model. Any new lines in the original text will be replaced by a blank line in the output, and each original paragraph will be split into multiple output paragraphs. A blank paragraph indicates the end of one speaker and the beginning of the next."

"The model will continue speaking until it encounters a blank paragraph or the end of the original text."

"This is a model that was trained only on written text. It is possible that the model makes mistakes in the output. Here are some examples of common errors."

"- The model can be confused by numbers in text. Please be sure to use proper nouns and sentences, avoiding numbers, dates, and any other potentially confusing numbers in text which could be mistaken for proper nouns and dates."

"- Named entities could also be confused, so please double-check that the outputted text is syntactically and semantically correct before using it."

"- The model may not be trained to recognise certain languages, which could lead to incorrect word choices. Please make sure to only train on text in a single language."

"- There are certain cultural elements, particularly in colloquial speech, that the model was not trained on. There could, therefore, be instances of improper grammar, pronunciation or colloquialisms."
