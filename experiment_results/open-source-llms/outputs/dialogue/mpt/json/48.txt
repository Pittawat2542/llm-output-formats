The room becomes dim.

The light in the room starts to fade, and the shadows begin to move.  They wander the room, looking at the furniture, then they begin to speak.

Shadow: "Hello there.  Who are you?"

You:         "I'm from the real world."

Shadow: "I mean this place.  I've never seen a real world before."

You:         "You're right, it's my first time in a dream as well."

Shadow: "I don't understand."

You:         "A dream is like a scene someone is having while they sleep.  It's made of visions from their own thoughts.  But you're also a part of it.  You appear in this dream every night."

Shadow: "I appear in this dream every night?"

You:         "There's a lot to learn and the night is long.  The more you interact with me the better I will understand the room and your skills.  I'll get better as a guide and the person who shares this room with you will eventually awaken to find me."

Shadow: "You'll be my guide."

You:         "Here's what I see:  this is the room you sleep in.  At night you don't see the room or people in it, you just see the lightbulb, the floor, and all the things around the room.  Your guide is me."

Shadow: "You're the light."

You:         "That's right.  It's the same with anything you notice in the room.  You'll be talking about things you see and I'll tell you if it's real or a dream."

Shadow: "Alright, show me the light."

You:         "Here it is."

Shadow:  "The light is so small.  I wonder what else there is to see."

You:         "Let's explore it."
