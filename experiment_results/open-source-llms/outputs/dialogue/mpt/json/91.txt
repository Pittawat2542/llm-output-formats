The two characters begin to converse, each offering information, asking questions, and commenting on the other character's responses.

> The player character: It has been a long time, it feels strange to actually meet our enemy.
>
> The monster: You were the one who invaded me. I thought I'd kill you, but you proved far stronger than I imagined. I'll have to remember to do some training to prepare for our next encounter, as your skill and dexterity leaves me far behind.

> The player character: I will admit that you are far more adept with a sword than I am. I suppose we both learned to wield a blade to defend against threats against our homeland, but it looks like I have a lot more training to do to become as skilled as you are. In return, I can help you in your journey if you will allow me to accompany you.

> The monster: Your skills prove that there is some good in you. I cannot blame you for wanting to fight for your homeland. Your father was a good man, and it saddens me that he died in vain. But you have more to learn. If you wish to accompany me, you will need to learn more to match my skill, or at least be able to keep up with what I teach you.

> The player character: I will gladly learn from you, I want to be a great warrior so I can fight for my people. I will use the information you teach me to help others in the future, so we can all be safe. I want to give back to my people and fight for them against future threats.
