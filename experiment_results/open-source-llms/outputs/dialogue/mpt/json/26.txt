Here is a script to generate a conversation between two characters. You can choose between a full dialogue with up to 4 sentences, or two sentences for narration. You can also specify a character name to be used in narration. 
This script returns a JSON output structure with dialogues and narration grouped by a `game` object. Each `game` object contains a list of dialogues or narration. Each dialogue or narration is structured as an object with properties for `order` (order within the full game or narration) and `speaker` (who is speaking in this dialogue/narration). The `text` property is the dialogue/narration itself.
 
Here are some examples:
 
```json
[{
    "game": {
        "dialogues": [{
            "order": "0",
            "speaker": "A",
            "text": "Hello, how are you"
        }, {
            "order": "1",
            "speaker": "B",
            "text": "Hello, I am ok"
        }, {
            "order": "2",
            "speaker": "A",
            "text": "Great, let's play a game"
        }]
    }
}, {
    "game": {
        "dialogues": [{
            "order": "0",
            "speaker": "A",
            "text": "Would you like to play a game?"
        }, {
            "order": "1",
            "speaker": "B",
            "text": "I would love too!"
        }, {
            "order": "2",
            "speaker": "A",
            "text": "Let's try playing Rock-Paper-Scissors!"
        }]
    }
}
```
