If I was to jump off the train and take a cab it would cost me a fortune. Finally, the train pulled into the station. I found my suitcase tucked away in the luggage rack and headed inside. I had to wait for a few minutes while they collected the luggage so that the train could leave. Finally, I got off and joined the crowd of people exiting the train. It was a hot, humid evening. As I walked through the station into the town I spotted a familiar looking man. It was Harry, my old friend from school. He had recently moved to this part of Switzerland,\n

Graham said to himself.
\u201d
\nHarry must have stayed here. I\u2019ll catch him later\n
Graham thought.
\n\n
\"Hi Graham\" Harry said as Graham joined him.
\n\n
\"Hi Harry\" Graham replied.
\n\n
\"Well, my family and I are staying at this hotel in town. They offered me a lift\"
Harry said.
\n\n
\"Sounds good\" Graham responded.
\n\n
Graham and Harry then parted ways and went their separate ways. Graham then caught a cab to the hotel which was a short distance away. When he got there he found that he could not check in. The hotel he had booked was full. He then headed for another hotel and found them similarly full. He decided to just go for a bite to eat and had a pizza near by. When he came outside it had started to rain but was still relatively pleasant. He caught a cab but it took them half hour because there was heavy traffic.
\n\n
\"Alright,\"
Graham exclaimed to himself, but this is probably the only hotel in this city\"
