Sure. What a great question! What I would like to propose is a simple format for generating a dialogue between two participants with a predetermined structure. So for example, dialogue order could be “turn taking” where the first participant speaks, a pause for a reaction, and then the second participant responds. The dialogue can be generated iteratively, with each participant having many options for each action.

Here is an example dialogue from the format:

**P1:** Hi, how are you?

**P2:** I'm great, thanks! And you?

**P1:** Great! I love the weather here.

**P2:** Me too. I think this summer is going to be very good.

**P1:** It sure is. I can't wait to go to the beach!

**P2:** Me neither! Have a good rest of your day!
