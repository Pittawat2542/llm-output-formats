The ship was quickly approaching the planet. Captain Jim looked out the window at the planet that was their destination. He saw an alien life form.
"You know, the planet looks a lot like the planet we found life on before, but we have to be sure," he said.
"Yeah," his first officer said. "I saw an animal on the shore that looked like it might be an animal we saw before, but I don't want to draw conclusions until we've investigated."
"Agreed," Captain Jim said. "Let's get closer and have a look."
The ship went into orbit of the planet and began doing a visual scan of the planet. In a couple of days, they located an area where the animals were. They were able to approach without being seen.
