The sun rose over the vast expanse of the Savannah and lit up the sky. The wind rushed over the open field carrying the scent of the wild grasses from the nearby swamp. The cicadas sang their melodic song, and the bright yellow and green birds of the Savannah chirped and flitted in the air, looking for their morning meal.

“Morning, princess!", called out the lion. “Can I have a sip of your milk?”

“Here you go, handsome”. The lion crouched down and sipped from the baby rhino’s fresh breast.

“Good boy! You know I’ll always feed you, don’t you?”, said the rhino.

“Of course, mom. I love you too”. The baby rhino nuzzled his mother’s neck and fell back asleep. The mother rhino stood up, stretched and yawned. She turned away from the beautiful sunrise and noticed the elephant and its calf grazing by a small stream.

“Look, it’s Pumba and his new baby!”. The rhino walked over to the elephants and introduced herself. 

“Oh! Hi!”, said the elephant.

“So, how is Pumba doing?” asked the rhino.

“I’ll let Pumba answer that, but he seems to have settled in well”. The elephant tapped the baby elephant on the head.

“Yeah, I’ve really settled in here!”, boasted Pumba.

“Glad to hear it. So, what’s new?” asked the rhino.

That's all.
