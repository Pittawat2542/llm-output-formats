Sure! I can do that. I’ll start by asking for some basic info up front in order to tailor the experience to your tastes:
    "Hi, how can I help?"

Alright let’s go for it. I’ll need some info about the type of story that you’re looking for.

For example, if you tell me that you enjoy reading a story about “a knight and a dragon”, I’ll give you an original story featuring that theme. 

Here’s some more info so you can tell me what else you’re looking for:

-   Stories with dragons:
    -   A story about a knight fighting a dragon
    -   A story about a dragon
-   Stories with an element of “time travel”:
    -   A story about an adventure in time
    -   A story about a character who travels back in time and the story that results from that
-   Stories of war:
    -   A historical novel, with war featuring prominently
    -   A modern military story
