OK! Here is some generated text between fictional characters:

The Doctor: You mean to say, the entire planet can be annihilated as a result of one man acting on an impulse of anger?

Tyler: That is what I mean.

The Doctor:  We have learned of many different alien races that have come to this planet. Some peaceful, some very dangerous. But rarely have we heard of a single, solitary human being as the catalyst to the destruction of an entire planet.

Tyler: But it happened. It was just the other day.

The Doctor: That is true.

Tyler: You know, I heard the alien race that destroyed this planet called the Thallonians.

The Doctor: That is correct. They are a species of advanced telepaths, that usually inhabit the far reaches of space. They are often xenophobic of other races, and will try to destroy them if they perceive a threat. But I have not heard of them causing genocide before.

Tyler: That is what makes it so tragic, is that the Thallonians are an advanced race, and yet the Thallonians' actions on this planet, caused the deaths of an entire race.

The Doctor: That is true. The Thallonians' destructive impulses on this planet was caused by jealousy. They were feeling threatened by the arrival of another alien race, and chose to destroy the planet, in hopes of making this other alien race flee the planet.

Tyler: However, it did not work. Their actions resulted in more alien races making contact with the planet.

The Doctor: That is correct. But the Thallonians were too late to undo their destructive actions.

Tyler: Perhaps they will realize what a mistake they made someday.

The Doctor: Or they may never realize that they are at fault for the genocide of their own race.

Tyler: We've learned that you have seen many planets and species, in your time traveling across the universe.

The Doctor: That is true.

Tyler: I often hear you refer to them affectionately as "gallifreyan" when describing them.

The Doctor: Gallifrey is the planet of my birth, a planet that was long ago destroyed...

Tyler: You don't seem to dwell on this too much.

The Doctor: It is true that I do not. I am able to draw on the memories of gallifreyan culture, and have been able to reconstruct the planet as it was when I was born. I no longer live there, but do so in my memories...

Tyler: Is this something you share with others, your memories of gallifrey?

The Doctor: No, I think it would be too dangerous for others to know such things. Gallifrey was a very powerful race. While I was able to live a long life, other races are not as fortunate.

Tyler: I'm sure I don't know as much about the galaxy as you do, so let me ask: Why are you even here?

The Doctor: I am here because I am curious about the universe in which we live.

Tyler: As am I.
