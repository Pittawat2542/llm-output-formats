Speaker: John

John: "Ah, it's so good to see you."

George: "Yeah, I've been thinking about when we'll talk next!"

John: "I'll be happy to talk to you whenever. I’ve been thinking too!"

George: "Oh, good! I’ve got a huge announcement to make, I think you’ll really like it!"

John: "Oh, exciting! Always love hearing about what you’re up to."

George: "Well, when I was going over to the library, I found this fascinating book."

John: "Oh my, what’s the title?"

George: "The History of the World in 101 Objects."

John: "Wow, I’d love to read that!"

George: "I was really impressed with how much knowledge it had in it."

John: "I bet, I should check it out. Tell me more."

George: "Okay, well I was reading the section about the first wheel."

John: "Great topic to cover first!"

George: "It says here that around 8000 years ago, a man from present-day Iraq began putting a wooden wheel in water."

John: "Very cool, I’ve always wanted to understand the significance of the wheel!"

George: "It says that this first wheel was used to grind grain."

John: "Ooh, I didn’t know it was for grinding grain too."

George: "Later, we’ll get to what people did with this first wheel."

John: "Sounds like this was a pretty big deal."

George: "Yeah, it even inspired the idiom 'At the wheel', referring to being in charge."

John: "Very interesting, please keep going."

George: "The book says this first wheel was used in Iraq, but some people think it came from Iran."

John: "They both seem close enough to me."

George: "The fact that this first wheel ended up in Iraq also means the origins of farming arose in that area."

John: "Oh wow, that’s amazing."

George: "They point out a lot of other interesting firsts in Iraq, like mathematics and writing, and that it was in Egypt that we first see the wheel for transport."

John: "Oh, I had no idea. This is so cool."

George: "They say that later, the wheel came to be used as a weapon of war and a tool for harvesting."

John: "Ah, it took a lot to earn these benefits."

George: "It says they think that by 5500 BC, this first wheel had spread across most of the Middle East."

John: "Interesting, I had no idea."

George: "We’ll come back to the wheel. What we really wanted to tell you about is the book."

John: "Sounds like the book is really good."

George: "Yeah, I recommend it. I’ll even let you borrow it if you like."

John: "That’d be amazing, thanks!"
