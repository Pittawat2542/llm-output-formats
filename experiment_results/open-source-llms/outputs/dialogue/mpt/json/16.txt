The rain is starting to fall, but it does little to douse the fires raging on the street corners.  You see people crying, fighting, dancing with the few others who remain.  If you look closely you can see a man who is obviously on drugs, a woman who has passed out and one man who looks completely deranged.  It is pandemonium.  

The girl, who is still alive and talking, says, â€˜The city is burning.'    

You ask her,  "What do you mean the city is burning?"   

She responds, "I mean, I feel like this city may be ending.  Everything feels like it is burning around me."    

You say, "Let's get out of here."  

The girl agrees.    

You tell her, "The water taxi is down the road. I'll meet you there."   

You turn around and leave the scene of destruction.   

As soon as you get far enough to not hear the fire and the yelling you turn around and run back to the scene of destruction. You can hear sirens in the distance.    

She was right, the city really is ending.
