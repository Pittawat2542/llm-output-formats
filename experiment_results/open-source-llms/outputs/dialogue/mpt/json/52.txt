Dialogue for Game 1.
Game 1 is a fantasy simulation game. In a forest, a man and a wolf. In the past, the world was not created in the state that humans and other beings live, but in the process of world creation, some creatures fought and fought until the other was destroyed. That man became a wolf. After that battle, the wolf, which gained the ability to speak by human, started to create its own world. In the process of creating its own world, the wolf encountered a wolf, a race that appeared at random, and the other wolf tried to kill it. At this time, the world that human and the wolf wanted to create could not be realized. The wolf that had lost its power as a human to fight and create the world again started to live on the forest like another wolf. And the process of this world is the game “Game 1”.

“There is only one rule.” As long as you play, the world will regenerate with the same events like the past every time. There is no goal, and the goal is only to survive as long as you can.
