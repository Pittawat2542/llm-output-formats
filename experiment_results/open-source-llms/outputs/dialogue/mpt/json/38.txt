### Speaker.
You wake up in the middle of the night. It’s pitch black outside, and you can feel the rain hitting your window. You stand up from your bed, feeling the cold carpet under your bare feet and walk towards the window.
### You.
The window looks out onto your garden, which is covered by darkness. It’s hard to see anything, but you can feel a cold breeze hitting your face as you look out.

### NPC.
This is a narrative game, so this is an example of the main character being told a story by another character. 
In this case, the main character is a young boy who's woken up by his parents in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. His parents then leave, leaving him to stand at the window watching rain fall from the sky. The scene is then cut to the boy and the window closes.
