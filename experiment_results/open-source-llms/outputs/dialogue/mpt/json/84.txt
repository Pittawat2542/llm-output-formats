"Hi, what is the game about?", Player 1

"Well, you are either a member of a terrorist organization or a secret agent trying to take them down. Your mission is to recruit people in your organization and eliminate members of the opposition. There are also neutral civilians in the game who are a neutral third party. You need to approach them, and they might either join your organization or the opposition. Alternatively, you could also take up other roles such as a journalist trying to write news articles and try to sway the innocent civilians' opinions in your favor or an evil overlord who sends in drones and other electronic warfare devices to either eliminate your opponents or infiltrate them and destroy their operations. There are a lot of strategies and the game has a lot of depth. If you have any questions about it, you can check out the game documentation or the game forum to find answers. Have fun!", Game Developer
