Let's start at the beginning:

Harry: I really love adventure games!

Hagrid: I can't say I'm familiar with them, my dear.

Harry: Really! They're amazing! They're like movies, but in a box! If you think about the way a video game has an animation of your character, it sounds like voice-acted dialogue, it's like getting that as a movie!

Hagrid: It sounds like an interesting way to experience them though.

Harry: They're a lot of fun!

Hagrid: That's great! I love seeing that you're so excited about something.
