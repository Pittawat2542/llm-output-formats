The two companions find themselves in an abandoned city. The place seems to be haunted by a shadowy presence, so the party keeps in the cover of darkness as they scout the area. They find some supplies and information that points to a former battle - they may be at the right location... or they may have walked into some kind of trap. Will the companions find themselves the victims of a nightmare, or can they uncover the truth about this abandoned city?
