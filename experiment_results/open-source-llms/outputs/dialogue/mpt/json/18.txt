OK here is the dialogue. To the best of my ability:

> “I have been expecting to find a very different scene here this evening”, said the detective, pointing down to where a body was lying on the floor. The dead body of the murdered man lay on the floor in the middle of the room, covered with a sheet. The murderers had left no clues about their identity; the room was in a state of utter confusion, as though the robbers had fled suddenly in the middle of the crime.

The murderer looked around the room, noticing the few valuables that had been taken from the murdered man. The inspector of the case, Charles Cale, and the assistant inspectors were looking at the other side of the room, where the valuables had been stored.
