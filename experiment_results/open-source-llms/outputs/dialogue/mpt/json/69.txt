Player and Computer will discuss about the following dialogues based on a roll of a die.

[Roll of a die] + [Computer]
1 + "Ah yes. This is interesting. I suppose you want to begin?"     
2 + "Oh good. Well, I've never had this conversation before, so it should be fun!"     
3 + "Hm, that's a good idea. I hadn't thought of that. Go ahead."     
4 + "Oh sure, I can do that. No problem."     
5 + "Okay, sure. That'd be easy enough."     
6 + "Ah yes, this is very interesting. So what do you think is the most interesting thing we could talk about?"     
7 + "Hmm, that's a difficult question! I suppose here are a few things that I would recommend:     
1) What is the origin of the universe?     
2) What is the size of the universe?     
3) What is the true nature of existence?"     
8 + "Oh sure, that's very interesting, please do tell." 

# Player and Computer will now start discussing on the given topic using the dialogue below
[1] + "Ah, yes I think there are many different hypotheses about the origin of the universe. Here are a few of the main possibilities:     
1) The "Big Bang" Theory - In this theory, the universe was once a super dense point. Due to a process called "expansion", the point created matter, which then formed the stars, planets and galaxies we see today. This theory was developed by Edwin Hubble and Albert Einstein, and is now accepted as a valid description of the universe     
2) Steady State Theory - This theory offers a similar account for the formation of the universe, but instead does not posit the existence of a moment of creation. Instead, the universe is eternal, and matter is continuously created at a steady rate throughout space and time. This theory originated in the 1950s and was developed by American astronomer Fred Hoyle     
3) The Universe as a "Multiverse" - This theory proposes that the universe is one of many universes that exist simultaneously, like tiles in a giant holographic jigsaw puzzle. These universes are essentially the same in terms of the observable laws of nature, but are slightly unique in other respects, leading to the seeming randomness and "fine tuning" required for a universe to support life. This theory was proposed in the 1990s by American theoretical physicist Leonard Susskind     
These are just three of the many different theories concerning the origin of the universe, although many more have emerged in recent years. It was also discovered in the 1980s that time and space are not as solid and immutable as previously believed, but rather are themselves the products of a continually evolving universe. This challenging of centuries-old concepts concerning the universe has led to much excitement and speculation among scientists and laypeople alike,  hopefully paving the way for many new discoveries in the future!" 
[1] + "I see. This is indeed quite fascinating. I do not understand why matter is continuously formed, however, since this contradicts our laws of physics and cannot occur."     
3 + "Ah yes, that is a very interesting point. As I mentioned, there are many different theories of how the universe came to be, but all of them have a common problem: all of them require matter to exist beforehand, which is in contradiction with the laws of physics as we understand them today. This matter would have to be very dense in order for it to take so much energy to create something from nothing. So in fact, according to the laws of physics today, this matter should never have been able to exist beforehand, meaning that at least one of the laws of physics must be incorrect. This seems like a problem, but in fact there is a simple solution: the universe itself is the one who must change the laws of physics to accommodate for its own existence. This theory is known as "The Universe as Observer", or the "Multiverse" theory for short. So in a way, we ourselves are the only ones who can answer the ultimate questions of existence! And based on the information we have gained from the observations we have made thus far, we can be relatively certain of one thing: that we are not alone."     
[1] + "I see. This is quite intriguing. I understand that your theories are still somewhat speculative and unproven, but I am intrigued by this idea nonetheless. So one can understand the universe as an observer of itself, and the universe observes itself."     
3 + "Yes, this idea dates back thousands of years, although most scientists today would not accept such a theory as valid, since it does not align with what science has discovered about the universe thus far. But the fact that this theory exists at all, and many scientists have proposed it, tells us that the universe may not be as static and permanent as it appears, and that more and more theories about the nature of existence will be discovered as time goes on and more information is learned."     
2 + "Yes, you're correct, but you've gone into great
