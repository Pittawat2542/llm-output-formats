A dialogue would consist of a set of conversational questions and answers. For example:
```json
{"game": {
    "dialogues": [{
        "order": "0",
        "speaker": "Jerry",
        "text": "Hello, Bob. How's it going? Welcome to our new house. I have to admit, it's a bit overwhelming, with all this junk. Here's an empty box. Would you mind getting rid of it for me?",
        "answers": [{
            "answer": "Sure!",
            "speaker": "Bob"
        }, {
            "answer": "No problem!",
            "speaker": "Bob"
        }]
    }, {
        "order": "1",
        "speaker": "Bob",
        "text": "Sure, I'll get it",
        "answers": [{
            "answer": "Here you go.",
            "speaker": "Bob"
        }]
    }]
}}
```
