Game development in the wild west is exciting and risky! You must be prepared. I'll walk you through how you can start to make and publish your own game, and what you can do to increase your chances to become the next big game developer.

How to start making games:

First, you will need some tools to make and publish the game. For the tools, we will be using Unity, which is a very user-friendly tool. To install Unity and start designing your game, you will need a computer and an internet connection. You can download a free Unity trial version here, which lets you design and publish your own game versions. 

Some other recommendations from game developers on what you can do to become a successful game developer is to do game development as a hobby or side hustle. By doing this, you should use more of your free time to create a game instead of having a full-time job that could distract you away from game development. Also, a common piece of advice is to use your free time and money to attend game developer and game industry courses. Once you have finished a course, you will be able to meet other future game developers and build a valuable network in the game industry.
