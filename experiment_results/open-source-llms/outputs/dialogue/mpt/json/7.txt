The human race had long forgotten of the existence of sentient lifeforms from another planet who visit our world. On a very remote planet, an alien race lands on Earth to meet the human race.

- An alien: The human lifeform is of great interest to our race. Our ancestors had used this planet as a source of minerals which had provided great benefit to our civilization. We have long forgotten of you.
- A human: I hope our meeting does not interrupt your plans. Our planet needs minerals that you have found, and we will be happy to trade with you.
- An alien: While we welcome visitors on this planet, we have a warning. The planet is under attack from a different race, and our planet needs your help.
- A human: We have learned about the situation. The survival of your species is of great importance to us as well. Let us work together to ensure the survival of your civilization.
