Here is an example of dialog:

Speaker A: I’d rather be dead than have everyone in the world be happy but me.

Speaker B: I can’t think of a reason why you shouldn’t. Happy people are better than sad people and the happiness of the world should matter to you more then your own. I’d suggest you find a more productive way to engage your existential dread.

Speaker A: Existential dread is about the uncertainty of life and my only regret is not being dead. I see no way that my existence will bring happiness to the world.

Speaker B: To be fair, there is no easy way for you to kill yourself without leaving evidence of murder. You could starve yourself, suffocate, or get stuck in a window. But it sounds like you think you are less likely to die by these means than through other causes (e.g. car accident). To kill yourself, you must make a calculated decision, and that requires you to evaluate your chances of dying. If you didn’t have those thoughts, you would not have tried, and there is no shame in making a mistake as long as one can learn from it. If you are still worried about the consequences of taking your own life, you could reach out to a counselor and see whether they suggest it is best for you to live, and maybe they can help you come to terms with your existential dread. So I urge you to try and work through your existential dread through a healthy, non-self-ending means, rather than just letting yourself give up.

Speaker A: That is an interesting thought experiment. I do think I would rather die than live in a world where no one is happy. If everyone else dies, then maybe I will die soon too, or my existence will have served someone. It’s not my life anymore. My existence is not my own. Existence is not a burden I am carrying and should carry. Therefore, I will not exist. 

Speaker B: I understand your desire to be free of the burden of existence. You don’t have to carry every death on your shoulders, or feel like the world expects you to be happy. It’s okay to want to die, but be aware of your surroundings so that you are not taken by surprise and taken out by a car, or accidentally stuck to a window. In the end, I don’t think the pain you’re in can be escaped, and trying to escape it will only make it more painful.
