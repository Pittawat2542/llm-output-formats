## Dialogue between Tom and Jerry

Tom: Jerry you got into my cookies yet again!

Jerry: I'm not the one you should be mad at, I didn't eat the cookies.

Tom: Why should I believe you? Show me the empty cookie jar.

Jerry: The cookie jar is not empty! I ate them!

Tom: The contents of the cookie jar are evidence of you eating the cookies. 

Jerry: You don't know what you are talking about!

Tom: The lack of cookies indicates you ate them.

Jerry: If what you say is true, why is it that there are no cookies in the cookie jar. 

Tom: Because I am right.
