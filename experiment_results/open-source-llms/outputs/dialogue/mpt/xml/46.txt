> Hi there! Welcome to this awesome game! I will guide you through the process and just remember: "Always keep your friends close, and your enemies closer!". You should use the "look" command to examine the environment. Just type "look" and hit enter. If you want to see more about the commands type "help" and hit enter. Press enter to continue.

> Well the objective of the game is to have each player collect three pieces of jewelry and return to the "safehouse". But I hear you might have met some resistance from bandits. This is a survival game, so I don't think any of your characters will die, but you might have to face some tough combat situations. I know you have some training with weapons, let's check what weapons and armor you currently have, just type "inventory" and hit enter.

> Ok I have found and taken the initial weapons. I will need a bow, arrows and a long sword. Let's create our initial equipment by typing the following commands. I will start with the bow

> You need to draw the bow, press "S" to draw and "L" to fire on any nearby enemies. Here let me show you how to aim: To aim with the mouse, hold down the "S" and click the left button. To aim with the keyboard, press the number 3 until a blue circle appears to show you are aimed and "L" to fire and destroy any enemies within range. Good the bow, here you could reload with "L1" and try the bow again. You should now equip the bow by typing "equip bow" and hitting enter.

> And another thing, you should be able to use the bow on the bandits, just type "target bandit" and hit enter to target the closest bandit. You can also target by moving your mouse over enemies, press "R" to fire. Again, use the keyboard to aim the bow.

> Now for the long sword let's type "equip sword" and hit enter.

> I will take the long sword and let's also see the sword, we use the same method to move our mouse or press "w" to move our cursor. Once the "S" key light is on you can then click or press the keyboard to attack, just press the space bar if you don't want to attack.

> Here let's do a test of the sword: Let's attack the bandits near by. First I will move my cursor around to find the bandits, move my cursor to the target which is the closest, then press space bar or press "S" to attack, watch out bandits will attack back. Once I am dead, I need to quickly type "target bandit" and move my mouse to find the nearest bandit and kill him. Then repeat again, until I have killed all the bandits.

> And once you have all the bandits dead, you can now take the loot and leave, just type "leave" and hit enter. You know the loot can be very useful and they are required to upgrade your equipment at the "safehouse"

> As you know the first thing you require is a long sword, let's talk about where to find the long sword let's type "long sword" and hit enter. You found the long sword, just bring me back the long sword and we can leave this place. Ok let's get the long sword

> You will need to be facing a guard let's target that bandit and then use the long sword to hit them "long sword" and "hit" you could use the space bar instead. Once he's dead he will spawn the long sword for you. Now that long sword is now yours, use the "equip sword" command again to

> If you ever find yourself "empty" of your melee weapon and need to attack enemies with it, just simply type "hit" to use your default weapon against enemies.
