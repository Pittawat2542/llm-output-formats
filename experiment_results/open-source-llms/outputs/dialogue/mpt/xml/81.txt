			<text>Hi, how are you today! It's lovely weather over here, I can totally see why you're having a great time in Oslo. I've been really enjoying myself as well, I'll never get tired of visiting museums and galleries in different countries. I'm actually going to be in Oslo for a few more days; I've just finished some work that I can finally share with you. I'd love to meet up over brunch or coffee and share what I've been working on!</text>
