The scene opens in Act I as a pair of lovers are sharing an intimate moment together. The setting is a romantic hotel room with heavy red drapes and candles burning. The woman puts her hand on the man's leg and leans in to kiss him eagerly.

“This has been the most wonderful trip,” she says in a hushed tone.

He chuckles and strokes her hair. “This is what marriage is supposed to be like,” he says, laughing.

“I hope so,” she says, smiling.

They sit in silence for a few minutes. The man strokes her knee, and she leans in to kiss him again.

“Did you know that my flight is tomorrow at noon?” she asks.

He nods. “I knew you were on a business trip,” he says.

She frowns. “What did you think I was doing here with you?” she asks jokingly.

He laughs. “I know you’ve never been anywhere else,” he says.

She smiles. “I’ve always wanted to go on a long trip, though. Maybe we can do that next time. But I’ve got to go,” she says, standing up.

“Are you leaving already?” he asks, taking her hand and pulling her toward him.

She kisses him and then gives him a quick kiss on the cheek. “I wish you were coming with me. You’d love all the history and culture,” she says.

He smiles. “I know you’d love to explore all the amazing sex that the world has to offer,” he teases as she exits the room. The hotel door closes behind her. He smiles to himself, gets off the couch, and pours himself a drink.
