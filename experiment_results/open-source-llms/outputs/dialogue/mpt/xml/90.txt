Character 1:

Hello, here is a new game to try. You play as a knight who is looking to become the greatest archer in the land.  

Game title: 
 Knightly Archery

<br>Character 2:

This game looks pretty cool. I see you are playing a knight. Do you have to shoot arrows in this game?

Character 1:

Oh yes. Shooting arrows accurately is a key aspect of this game, and is how the player increases their rank.

<br>Character 2:

Thatâ€™s interesting. I wonder how you get the knight to shoot those arrows in the game.

Character 1:

The knight runs to a target, aims their bow, and pulls the string on the bow to fire an arrow. There are also magical elements that can be unlocked as well as additional bows and arrows to improve the player's abilities.
