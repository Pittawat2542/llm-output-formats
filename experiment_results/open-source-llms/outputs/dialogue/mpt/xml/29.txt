> Player 1: I hope John was able to get out of there safely.
> Player 2: John's not the brightest bulb in the box, but I think he did okay.  The robot just chased him into the warehouse, so I don't know what's going to happen!
> Player 1: I hope that robot doesn't hurt him.  I really don't want to lose John. You know what would be funny? If the robot ends up killing him.
> Player 2: Kills John? Oh boy, that would be fun.  I've got a funny feeling the robot's gonna kill him!
