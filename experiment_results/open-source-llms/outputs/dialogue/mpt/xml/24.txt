## Dialogue
Player One: "How about another round?"

Player Two: "OK!"

# Conversation
Player One: "I have two hands."

Player Two: "So you do."

Player One: "Sure. I have two hands and two feet. So that works for me."

Player Two: "It does."

Player One: "OK, here's some more about me."

Player Two: "Please do."

Player One: "I have a nose, two eyes and a mouth."

Player Two: "I can see that."

Player One: "It's not so important, but I can also touch things."

Player Two: "I see."

Player One: "Here's an example:"

Player Two: "OK"

Player One: "This can be a door knob. It's made of metal, it's cold and I can move it with my hand."

Player Two: "I get it."

Player One: "I can push it with my finger to open the door."

Player Two: "Why did you say that? Nobody here can see what's happening."

Player One: "Well, I just like talking about how I touch things."

Player Two: "OK, sure."

Player One: "I have to work really hard. As far as I know, that's what separates me from animals."

Player Two: "Interesting."

Player One: "I also talk and think and remember things, and also have a brain."

Player Two: "OK, so you're basically a human."

Player One: "You got that right."

Player Two: "I thought you'd be a little more specific."
