Agent: I’m so glad you called, John. How was your vacation?

John: It was great. We had such a good time at the beach. I can’t wait to go back!

Agent: Tell me about it. I love being at the beach too. If I was rich, I totally would have my own beach house, like a mansion that’s right on the ocean. I’d spend all my time there. It would be great. 

John: Mm-hmm, that does sound pretty nice. I do like the beach very much. I go all the time and I enjoy getting away from everything. It’s really relaxing to just lay out in the sun, swim in the ocean, and have a good time with friends or family. 

Agent: It really can be a very refreshing change of pace, and a nice way to take a break from everyday life. There’s something very calming and peaceful about being at the beach. I love going back there. I’d love to have a beach house too, it sounds like so much fun! 

John: It sounds like a good deal to me! You know, it’s funny because when I think about a vacation, and a beach house sounds great to me too! I haven’t thought much about it before, but it really would be wonderful to have a house right on the ocean, with all the beach stuff and just having a place to walk to at any time. 

Agent: I can see why! When I think about relaxing places, the beach is definitely at the top of the list. It sounds like you have had some great beach adventures, and I hope there are more to come!
