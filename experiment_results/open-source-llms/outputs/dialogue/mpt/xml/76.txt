	I know you've never told me this, but I just wanted to be sure that I was on the correct page. <speaker name="Lenny Busker" />
	<order>12</order>
	You have no idea how badly I wanted to find you. <speaker name="Jack McRae" />
	<order>13</order>
	Just one little question. <speaker name="Lenny Busker" />
	<order>14</order>
	Oh, that's easy. <speaker name="Dex Dexter" />
	<order>15</order>
	Why don't you tell me, I'll listen. <speaker name="Jack McRae" />
	<order>16</order>
	I just want to be sure I have this right. 
	<speaker name="Lenny Busker" />
	<order>17</order>
	I know there's a lot you've kept to yourself, and I just want to be sure I haven't said anything to offend or hurt you.
	<speaker name="Dex Dexter" />
	<order>18</order>
	So you want to tell me why you're in my office. 
	<speaker name="Jack McRae" />
	<order>19</order>
	A little over a year ago, I received a message from you. It was cryptic, but I knew it was from you. I've been waiting for you to contact me ever since.
	<speaker name="Lenny Busker" />
	<order>20</order>
	That's really sweet, I still have that message you sent me. I was hesitant to contact you for so long, I didn't know how you would take it, but I was so happy that you responded.
	<speaker name="Jack McRae" />
	<order>21</order>
	I know you're out there, and I wanted to let you know that I'm still ready.
	<speaker name="Lenny Busker" />
	<order>22</order>
	You did know I was still interested, didn't you? I was a little hesitant, but then I knew I could trust you, and I couldn't resist asking.
	<speaker name="Jack McRae" />
	<order>23</order>
	I'm sorry I've been so bad about communicating, but I wanted to wait for the right moment, and it finally seems like this is it. 
	<speaker name="Lenny Busker" />
	<order>24</order>
	I couldn't have planned it better if I had been trying.
	<speaker name="Dex Dexter" />
	<order>25</order>
	Lenny. I've been trying to find you.
	<speaker name="Lenny Busker" />
	<order>26</order>
	We need to talk.
	<speaker name="Dex Dexter" />
	<order>27</order>
	I'm at the cafe downstairs. 
	<speaker name="Lenny Busker" />
	<order>28</order>
	I'm just going downstairs to get a cup of coffee. We'll talk when I get back.
	<speaker name="Dex Dexter" />
	<order>29</order>
	Alright, we'll talk later. Bye.
	<speaker name="Lenny Busker" />
	<order>30</order>
	I'll be right down.
	<speaker name="Dex Dexter" />
	<order>31</order>
	What's going on.
	<speaker name="Lenny Busker" />
	<order>32</order>
	I want to tell you something.
	<speaker name="Dex Dexter" />
	<order>33</order>
	Please.
	<speaker name="Lenny Busker" />
	<order>34</order>
	I don't know how I'll be able to explain, so I want you to promise you'll listen and that you'll treat what I'm about to tell you as confidential.
	<speaker name="Dex Dexter" />
	<order>35</order>
	I promise.
	<speaker name="Lenny Busker" />
	<order>36</order>
	A friend of mine who I was close with for a number of years passed away suddenly two years ago, but I never told you because I didn't want to burden you with my sadness. I think you would have understood, but I just didn't feel like asking.
	<speaker name="Dex Dexter" />
	<order>37</order>
	I'm sorry to hear about your friend.
	<speaker name="Lenny Busker" />
	<order>38</order>
	Don't be. I knew it would bother you. I just wanted to tell someone who would understand.
	<speaker name="Dex Dexter" />
	<order>39</order>
	It's ok to be sad. Your friend is still very much present in your heart, and you should never be ashamed of missing him. I am sad for you.</speaker>
