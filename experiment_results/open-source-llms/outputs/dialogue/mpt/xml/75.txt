"Let’s begin the game."

"OK."

"The game is very easy."

"OK. I would expect as much from you."

"You will be the GM, and I will be the player."

"Sure. Go ahead."

"As the GM, I will ask you questions."

"OK"

"We will play as an NPC and a PC."

"As the player, I have no idea what that means."

"Don’t worry. I will be the NPC and you will be the PC."

"OK, OK. I will try to do the best I can with what I know."

"Good. The world in which our game takes place is similar to Earth."

"I know."

"It has space travel, but you are not the astronauts we often see in movies and TV shows."

"True, the astronauts in our world do not venture very far from home, and they don’t go outside."

"They work in space factories or on space farms."

"I get it. Now tell me about the NPC."

"OK. This is a woman who works in space in a position where she is required to go out. She loves her job, but she is very nervous about it."

"She’s an engineer. She is in charge of space exploration."

"Right. She is in charge of an important project."

"She is also in love."

"Love? What does this have to do with space travel?"

"As I said, she is very nervous about going out, because she might die."

"I know people who have died from cancer. That isn’t the same thing at all!"

"I know that."

"OK, tell me more."

"One year ago she went out past the orbit of Earth for the first time."

"I know. I am not asking you to explain."

"A year ago, she went out with more than 200 other people. They were in their ships. The ships were all connected."

"I know. Everyone got home safely."

"That is what she wants, but she cannot be sure."

"I know, I was there, and I can’t be sure."

"Maybe she will be all right."

"I hope so."

"Maybe she will be the next person to die, and I might die with her."

"I know. I hate that I might die before she does."

"I hate that, too."
