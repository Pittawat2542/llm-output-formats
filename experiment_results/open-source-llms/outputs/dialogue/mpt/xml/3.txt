A dialogue is any conversation between two or more characters. Dialogue is often structured in a numbered or unnumbered sequence of lines, as in a stage play. These numbered or unnumbered lines of dialogue are called "scenes", just like stage scenes. 

The following example is a dialogue using numbered lines, with opening quotes and closing punctuation:

Scene 1:

"Hello," said Tom to Alice.

"Hello," replied Alice.

Scene 2:

"It's wonderful to see you again," said Tom.

"You too," responded Alice.

A dialogue using numbered lines, with opening speech marks only:

Scene 1: "Hello."

Scene 2: "Hello."
