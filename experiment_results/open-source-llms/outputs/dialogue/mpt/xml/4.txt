“The sun rose on the Earth today on Sunday, July 3, 2055; the year in which the world ends. Everyone I’ve met has already died, though some were kind, if strange. I haven’t yet met a human being, but I do interact with androids, who have the same quirks and personalities as humans, and even love unrequited love as much as any human.”
