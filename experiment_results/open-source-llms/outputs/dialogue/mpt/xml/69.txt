# Dialogue 1

Xue: You can't kill me. I won't die and I'll ruin everything! You have to let me live!

Drew: Shut up!

Xue: I will not shut up! If you want to die, let me live! Let me ruin your city and everyone who's part of it!

Drew: You shut up right now, or I'll kill you. Or better yet, I'll lock you up forever and you'll be so happy, you'll finally get some peace!
