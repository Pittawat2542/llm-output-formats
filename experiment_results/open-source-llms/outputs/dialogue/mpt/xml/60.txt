Hello, this is a game text dialogue system. Would you like for me to start a new game?

Sure. I'll be as specific as I can be. There's an underwater city that needs to be defended from invaders. I will provide information as the game progresses, but in a nutshell:

- Underwater: some are friendly, many are hostile
- Invaders: they are attacking
- Defenders: we are defending
- Defending city: the city where we defend
