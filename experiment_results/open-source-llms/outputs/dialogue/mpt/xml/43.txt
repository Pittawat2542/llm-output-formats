The dragon king entered his chamber and sat at his massive table in contemplation. "Why must I be saddled with this cursed duty?" he sighed. "How can the Fates allow a single being to bear such responsibility?"

The giant king of dragons continued his melancholic musing as the sun came up, and the colors of dawn lightened the murky air. Sensing the presence of the king, hundreds of lesser dragons arrived bearing food and drink. Even in his sorrow, the dragon king delighted in the simple pleasure of being surrounded by his subjects and the warmth their attentions brought him.

"I have considered ending this burden," the king mused as he finished his morning meal. "I can simply let the realm crumble, and the Fates will take it upon themselves to punish those who have grown complacent."

"Let me consider that, my king," a great golden dragon offered with a nod. "We could gather an army of dragons to rise up against the world! We could strike against mankind, and take everything that we desire, without restraint!"

"That would be glorious," agreed the king. "The destruction of mankind and all things that serve it would be glorious indeed. My pride would be fed."

"No," the great golden dragon countered, "it would be wise."

"What a noble thought, O wise one." the dragon king said, nodding his head to indicate his appreciation. "I would love to unleash a world destroying army upon the world, but...but..."

The king's great eyes widened as his thoughts finally worked out. 

"If I struck, I would risk harm to my own people." the king finished. "I would have to strike carefully so as not to harm myself."

"You have no reason to fear the world, my king," the golden dragon offered in an soothing tone. "We are far mightier than men know or understand. Our actions bring us only power, and with time we can make a world which is now so alien to our desires ours to command."

"And yet," the king objected, "I still feel that the Fates will be displeased. How can I make them understand the truth of this situation, so that I can justify ending my rule?"

"I will consider this," the king decided as he gave a nod of approval to the golden dragon who presented him with a gift as a token of his esteem. 

The king departed in the same mood with which he had arrived. He still worried about the responsibility which bore down upon him, and he would brood over whether to let the realm collapse around him or not. As the hours and days passed, and the King of Dragons turned his thoughts to the day's activities, the day's activities also turned to his thoughts.
