John asked Ann if she could join a game with them in their new virtual reality world called Hytale. Ann was overjoyed but wanted to know more about the game.

"Hytale is a vast virtual reality world where you can explore, meet new friends, learn new skills and create whatever game content you desire." Ann replied, impressed by the depth and breadth of the game. John asked her if she had any experience with game creation and she replied, "I love to code and build things but have no prior experience in game making or coding. Any advice?" John explained that Hytale has a very active community and that there are several tools to help the beginner make their own games and worlds. Ann eagerly started building content for their new world and is having a lot of fun designing and creating.

John then asked if Ann would like to take a break and grab a bite to eat. Ann agreed and the three of them used the in-game transportation system to navigate to a nearby restaurant to enjoy a tasty dinner before returning to their adventure.
