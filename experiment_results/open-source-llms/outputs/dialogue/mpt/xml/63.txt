Sure, here's a random dialogue between two friends:

John: "I went to the movies with my friend Sam last night, and we saw this new spy movie! It was so good."

Sam: "Really? I don't know if I'll ever get to see it though. I have this huge exam in computer science tomorrow, and I've been studying nonstop."

John: "Oh, that sucks for you! If you pass you'll have this degree though, and it'll be so worth it."

Sam: "I know, I just need to get through this one."
