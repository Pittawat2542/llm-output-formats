Well that's certainly very strange behaviour. One moment while I think what this situation might mean.
Alright so it sounds like the person in front of you is a bit out of character. What I would advise is that you continue to treat this person as you would any regular human. Do not feel under any obligation to allow this person to get their way or bend any rules! Remember that you are in the right here, if someone treats you in a rude or out of character fashion you have every right to call them out. It might help to say "I know this might be a strange request but it's crucial that you understand this is non-negotiable", this will set the ground rules and show confidence, which is a trait many people lack, and will make them back off. You can also try being friendly and joking around, often people are so caught up in their own head space that they can't make sense of the situation and will revert to their normal self. Try using the following "I know you've been going through a lot but you still need to make sure to wear a mask if you're in a crowd" and wait and see what happens. The most important thing is, it's vital to know when you've got people on your back foot. There's no reason to put up with rude or odd behaviour, if someone starts being disrespectful you have every right to call them out on it!
