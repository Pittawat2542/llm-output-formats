It was a beautiful summer day. I had just been offered a promotion at work and I was on my way to meet with my boss and my new team to discuss my new role! I was so excited. I thought about how far I’d come in such a short amount of time. Just a few years ago I was working part-time at a fast-food restaurant to support my family, and now I was being offered a new position in management! How proud I was of my accomplishments, I knew this new role would only come from much dedication and hard work, and I had earned it. As I drove down the highway to the office, I was so filled with joy. I couldn’t wait to meet my team and tell them my good news!
