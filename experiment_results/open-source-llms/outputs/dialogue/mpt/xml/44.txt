Here's a simple example:

A: Okay, so your character has received a mission from their superiors. The assignment is vague but it could be important. Here's what they know so far:

* The target is on a heavily fortified planet
* The target is protected by a formidable defense
* The target doesn't know the character is coming
* No information is known about the target or their defenses

The character heads off to prepare for the mission and as part of that process learns some details:

* The target has a security force that is smaller and less equipped than the defense
* The target is known to be armed with powerful weaponry
* It appears that the target is receiving regular shipments of weapons and other equipment
* The target has a personal guard

After additional training, the character heads for the target's planet. As they get closer, they realize:

* An alien species is protecting the target
* It appears that the aliens are hostile. The alien species that is defending the target is seen regularly attacking passing ships
