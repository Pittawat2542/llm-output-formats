Agent: Ok, I understand. I’ll go ahead and answer based on the information you just said, in this dialogue format:

Assistant: (Speaks the input given to it.)

Agent: Okay, I have some basic information on the topic you asked about, about the size of a human head on a mouse. I can’t really answer all the questions you asked in detail though. I might be able to help if you narrow down the topic you want to discuss and you can give me more details.

Assistant: (Speaks the input given to it.)

Agent: That’s fine, I can give you some options for narrowing it down if you’d like.

Assistant: (Speaks the input given to it.)

Agent: I have a few ideas. How about we focus on a specific animal, like the rabbit.

Assistant: (Speaks the input given to it.)

Agent: I have some information on the topic you asked about, about how big a rabbit’s head is. What I can’t do is tell you anything about how large the brain of a rabbit is because I don’t know what “the brain of a rabbit” is. I think you meant to ask about the “weight” of the rabbit’s brain, not its “size” - can you try again using the word “weight”?

Assistant: (Speaks the input given to it.)

Agent: That’s more like it! I can answer your question on the topic about the brain of a rabbit. To be more specific, I can tell you that in the body of a 6-pound rabbit, its brain weighs about 3 ounces.

Assistant: (Speaks the input given to it.)

Agent: And I can also confirm that a 3-ounce weight, in mouse units, is roughly equal to 4 grams. That information might be helpful for you.

Assistant: (Speaks the input given to it.)

Agent: It’s also worth mentioning that your answer to the question you asked, on an adult human, is that their head is equal to about 1.2 kilograms, or 2.7 pounds.
