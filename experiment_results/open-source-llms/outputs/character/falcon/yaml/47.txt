Game is a character in an RPG who is defined by their physical appearance, age, birthplace, and associated role. Characters may have a background story, detailed statistics or other traits, and relationships to other characters in the game. Some characters have unique abilities and powers; others may have special equipment.

In addition to the data fields, additional fields like "race", "alignment", and "alignment alignment" can be used to define more complex character data structures. A description of each field can be found in the online documentation of the YAML library used for formatting, which will be specified as the "source".
