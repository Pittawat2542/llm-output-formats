The character has a slight build, standing at a lean and mean 6'2". Their black hair is slicked back, giving them a commanding yet approachable appearance. His piercing green eyes seem to hold a spark of intensity, a trait that's always drawn him to the darker side of life. With his light beard and distinct scar above his lip, it's clear that this character has seen a lot more than his fair share of danger. As a born and raised city dweller, it's safe to say that he's comfortable in his surroundings, but there's always trepidation lurking under the surface.
