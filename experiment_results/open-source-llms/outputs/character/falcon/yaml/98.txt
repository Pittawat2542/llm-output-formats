```yaml
# Markdown content

Markdown YAML is a markup language used for writing structured information and is commonly used in documentation. It can be used to declare and define variables that are used throughout the document. For example, the following declaration specifies the `character` tag within the YAML code block.

The structure of the `character` tag depends on the type of information you want to include. Here are some examples:

- `game`: Specifies the name of the game associated with the character profile.
- `character`: Declares a new `character` tag.
- `first_name`: First name of the character.
- `last_name`: Last name of the character.
- `age`: Description or exact age of the character.
- `id`: A player ID or any unique identifier in the game.
- `background`: Description or story of the character in the game.
- `physical_appearance`: A list tag of properties such as eye color, hair color, height, weight, place of birth, and role in the game.
- `place_of_birth`, `role`, and `species` are YAML tags to be declared and defined in the Markdown code. The `age` tag is optional and only needed if you want to include it.

In summary, the `character` tag allows you to declare a new character within the YAML code block and provide information about their attributes or properties.
