<p>Here's an example of a character profile in YAML format:</p>

<pre><code>game:
  character:
    id: id
    first_name: first name
    last_name: last name
    age: exact age or description
    physical_appearance:
      eye_color: eye color
      hair_color: hair color
      height: height in float value
      weight: weight in float value
    place_of_birth: location
    species: species
</code></pre>

<p>Replace the comment in the code block with the information you would like to include about the character. The "age" field should be set to "exact age or description" and "place of birth" with "location".</p>
