# Markdown code block
In the above example, the `character` is defined as Markdown with `# Character information`. The attributes of `character` are:
```
# Output format
```
```
In the above code block, the `game` element is defined as a YAML block with two main sections: `character` and `place of birth`. The attributes of each section are:
- `game`: `# Output format` sets the YAML block name.
- `character`: `background`: a string of text that encapsulates the story or details behind the character.
- `place_of_birth`: `# Markdown code block`.
- `# Attributes`: `# Markdown code block`.
