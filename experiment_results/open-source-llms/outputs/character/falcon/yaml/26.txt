John Grayson had a childhood filled with a family of warriors. From a very young age, he trained extensively in combat, learning from his relatives the art of swordplay, archery, and hand-to-hand combat. Despite his imposing look with his imposing height and muscle mass, John is very gentle and kind-hearted. He never uses his combat skills for harm, instead opting to use them to protect those he cares about.
