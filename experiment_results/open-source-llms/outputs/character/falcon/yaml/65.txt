Inclusive of the above is YAML.
YAML
```java
# character.yml
# In the age group, we take the precise age or description from Markdown.
# In the background section, we take the name of the character's home
# town or any town.
# In the physical appearance sections, we take the precise weight
# height in feet or centimetres, and the eye color is in the
# "eyes" section.
# In the "game" section, we take the character's name or title
# but exclude the "character" section and "game" label.
```

```
@YAML

The YAML code is indented in the Markdown language to maintain the consistency of the output. The character information included is "age", "background", and "visual" information.
