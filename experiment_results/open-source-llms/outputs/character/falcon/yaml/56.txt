character_name: 
  app_name: character_name

Replace the `<age or age range>` with the precise age of the character. `<rpg or story explanation>` can be used if the character has a specific role or backstory within the narrative. `<name of current character>` is the name specified in the character profile that can be used to reference the character. For example, if the character's first name is John in the 2020 role-playing game, the character should be written: "John".
