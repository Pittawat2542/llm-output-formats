Characters should have a specific physical appearance and a unique backstory. The physical appearance can include features like eye color, hair color, height, and weight. The role of the character should be defined, and the species should make some sense within the story. For example, for a werewolf, you can mention that they are 'usually associated with a wolf-like appearance'.
