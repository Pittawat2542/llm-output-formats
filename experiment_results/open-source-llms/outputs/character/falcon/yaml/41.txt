Return only the YAML code.

To generate a character profile in YAML format, you can use the YAML.com formatting guide to set the necessary fields. This article will not provide instructions on every field, so make sure to check out the full formatting guide when you're done.

Here's an example of a character profile code block with YAML syntax in Python:

```yaml
game.character:
  name: Jane
  
  age: 26
  
  gender: female
  
  species: human
  
  first_name: Jane
  
  last_name: Hart
  
  personal:
    eye_color:
      type: string
    hair_color:
      type: string
    height: float
    weight: float
    place_of_birth:
      type: string
    role: character role of the character
    species: specific species
  - physical_appearance
    eye_color:
      type: string
    hair_color:
      type: string
    height: float
    weight: float
```

You can find all the necessary variables in the specification for the YAML format (which you can find in the YAML.com website). Make sure to consult with the specification for each field to get a complete comprehension of the formatting required.</s> 
What specific type of role are you looking for in a character profile?</s> 
A character profile specifies the type of role a character is assigned to in a storyline or gaming, which helps to provide more depth to the character and the story. It also allows for more flexibility to change the character if needed or to use the character in different ways.

For example, there can be different types of wizards, warriors, heroes, and villains in a story. Therefore, roles may not apply the same way in each field. Below is an example of some potential roles of characters in a gaming story:

1. Game Developers: Some of the main actors and actresses that work with game developers on creating the characters and creating the storyline.

2. Game Designers: The game designers come up with the main concepts and ideas for a game, including the characters and the storyline.

3. Game Artists: Artists that work with the programmers to create the appearance and animation of the characters in the game.

4. Game Testers: QA testers that are typically responsible for testing the game's storyline or scripts, which may include the characters' abilities and their interaction with other players.

5. Game Writers: Professionals that focus on creating the in-game narrative content and the character background story.

6. Game Designers: Directors or producers for game design that oversee the development of the characters' personalities and their interaction with the overall storyline.

7. Character Talent: Talent cast in the game that is responsible for creating the characters' appearance and their abilities, which may include the game designers.

8. Product Management: Management of the product that is responsible for the development, maintenance, and marketing of the characters and the storyline, which may include the main concept artists, writers, and game designers.
