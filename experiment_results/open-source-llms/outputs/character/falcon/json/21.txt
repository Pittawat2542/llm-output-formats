# Markdown code block
---
# Add the character's image
## **Example image**

- `{{!image`
  - `{{<image src="path/to/image.jpg"/>`
  - `{{/image}}`
- `{{!description`
  - `{{<description>Species: Dragonborn (humanoid) - Humanoid that has the breath of fire.</description>`
  - `{{/description}}`
- `{{!game`
  - `{{<game key="game">
<![CDATA[The Character, Their Game, And Backstory]]`
    - `{{/game}}`
```

In this example, I have used markdown syntax to create a Markdown code block, where the outermost block is the character object and its JSON data. Within the character data, the JSON object is defined with the key `game` and the inner JSON object is defined as a key with the same name. I have used JSON.stringify() function to convert the inner JSON object to a string in json.parse() format, which can be included in the Markdown code block.
