The `character` property is used to store and retrieve various attributes of a single character such as ID, first name, last name, etc. These attributes can be keys in the `game` object and their values can be updated through the `character.first_name`, `character.last_name`, `character.species`, `character.age` and `character.role` properties. Additionally, you can add "place of birth" and "physical appearance" properties to the `character` object by nesting them inside an array.
