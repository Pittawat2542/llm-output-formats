This JSON code block defines a character's properties, including their game character object which is in the top level. The nested JSON property `character.game` is in the format of an object, and contains an `array` property `game` with the name "character". The objects in the `character` property of the `game` object are nested inside multiple objects that are inside a single object with the name "game". The nested object `first_name` has values for "id", "first name", and optional "last name" properties. `last_name` and `species` may contain float values, and are optional. Optional properties `first_name`, `last_name`, and `species` should be set to `null` if the corresponding properties are not provided. The `age`, role, background, place of birth, and physical appearance are also optional and can be set to `null`. Here, the JSON is enclosed within a triple quotes (") and ended with double quotes (" double quotes (").
