Here is the character profile in JSON format. The key is "character" and this JSON within the script marks the output. 

Exact age or description is a string that describes the character's age in years.

To use this character in a markdown code block, the JSON code should have a line break so that it does not run off the screen.

Keep in mind that this structure may not work for all languages.
