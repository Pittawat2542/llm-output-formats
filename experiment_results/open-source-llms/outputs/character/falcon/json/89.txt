In this example, the `"first_name": "first name"`, `"last_name": "last name"`, `"species": "species"`, `"age": "exact age or description"`, and `"place_of_birth": "location"` properties are nested inside the `"game": `{` property. Inside that property, you can have multiple JSON properties, as there are no restrictions on the depth of the nested JSON.

The output would be:

```
{
  "game": {
    "character": {
      "id": "id",
      "first_name": "first name",
      "last_name": "last name",
      "species": "species",
      "age": "exact age or description",
      "role": "role of the character",
      "background": "background story",
      "place_of_birth": {"
        "eye_color": "eye color",
        "hair_color": "hair color",
        "height": "height in float value",
        "weight": "weight in float value"
      }},
      "physical_appearance": [
        {
          "eye_color": "eye color",
          "hair_color": "hair color",
          "height": "height in float value",
          "weight": "weight in float value"
        },
        {
          "eye_color": "other eye color",
          "hair_color": "other hair color",
          "height": "other height in float value",
          "weight": "other weight in float value"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Note that the JSON format is not always necessary for creating human-like characters if you only have limited properties.
