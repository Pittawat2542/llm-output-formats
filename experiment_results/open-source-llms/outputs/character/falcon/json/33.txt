To extract the JSON object from this Markdown code block, we can use Regular Expressions to match the keys and values, and convert the Markdown code block to JSON formatted JSON. We can then extract the JSON data and assign it to a separate variable, which will need to be inserted into our game's database design. Once extracted, we can use JSON.stringify() to convert the data to JSON formatted JSON and assign it back to a separate variable for insertion into the database.
