In this example, we have included a single character's profile within a JSON structure, with a Markdown block containing the character's properties and their JSON representation in curly brackets and hyphens. The JSON data is in `json` format with an empty `game` object before the character object, and a nested `character` object. The key names in the JSON data are shown in the `character` object (e.g. `age`), while the first level properties are wrapped in keyframes `first_name` through `last_name`. The `species` property has a nested property `species` to reflect different species. Finally, the top level properties are `game.character` followed by individual properties (`id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, etc.) that have properties (`id`, `first_name`, `last_name`), and each property has a nested `character` object.
