```javascript
{
  "game": {
    "character": {
      "id": "id",
      "first_name": "first name",
      "last_name": "last name",
      "species": "species",
      "age": "exact age or description",
      "role": "role of the character",
      "background": "background story",
      "place_of_birth": "location",
      "physical_appearance": {
        "species": [
            "species_1",
            "species_2",
           ...
        ],
        "gender": false,
        "race": false,
        "birth_date": "1990-06-26"
      },
      "height": 5.8,
      "weight": 50
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, the output format includes only the JSON value in the `game.character` format. The `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `species` properties are only required for JSON but not for HTML. 

The `age` property is optional in JSON format but is included to match the example. 

The `start` value is only used to mark the start of an object in the JSON. 

The `game` property is only required to specify the name of the property in the JSON format. 

The `json` property is optional in the JavaScript code and should be omitted.
