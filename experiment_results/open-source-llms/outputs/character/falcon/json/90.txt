{
    "game": {
        "character": (
            {
                "id": id,
                "first_name": first_name,
                "last_name": last_name,
                "species": species,
                "age": age,
                "role": role,
                "background": background_story,
                "place_of_birth": location,
                " physical_appearance": (
                    {
                        "eye_color": eye_color,
                        "hair_color": hair_color,
                        "height": height,
                        "weight": weight
                    }
                )
            },
            {
                "id": id2,
                "first_name": first_name2,
                "last_name": later_last_name,
                "species": species2,
                "age": age2,
                "role": role2,
                "background": <insert location information here>,
                "place_of_birth": "location2"
            }
        )
    }
}
```

In this example, if there are too many "id" fields, they will be truncated by removing their square brackets. If a "character_appearance" field is inside a "char_species" field, it will be repeated because it's a child of the "char" field. If an object doesn't have a "game" field, another object will be generated instead.
