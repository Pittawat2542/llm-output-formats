**The first parameter:**
Game:
- "name": The name of the game
- "characters": An array of character JSON objects. Each character object has the properties listed below. Each character object can have a property called "player" which is the character being described.

**The second parameter - "game":**
- "character": The character object that this description is about. It has the properties listed below.

**The third parameter - "characters":**
- This is an array of character JSON objects. Each object has the properties listed in the first parameter ("species", "age", etc. in JSON syntax). The "place_of_birth" property should be set to a city in the US rather than a zip code or state abbreviation. This is because many US cities have zip codes that are a combination of multiple cities or multiple states, making it difficult to correctly identify them.
- The "physical_appearance" property can contain arrays of objects with the following properties:
    - hair_color: A string or number that represents the hair color.
    - eye_color: A string or number that represents the eye color.
    - height: The height in meters or feet.
    - weight: The weight in kilograms or pounds.
    These properties are optional and can be left blank if the character is described only in a single sentence or phrase.
