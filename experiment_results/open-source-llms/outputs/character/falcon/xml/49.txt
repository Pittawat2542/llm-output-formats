In the example code block, a character's XML in Markdown format is enclosed by tags `<game>` and `</game>`. The `id` tag contains the character's unique identification number, while the `first-name` tag stores the character's first name. The `last-name` tag stores the last name, and the `species` tag specifies the species of the character if any. The `age` tag is optional and can be used to provide the exact age or description. The `role` tag stores the role of the character, and the `background` tag contains the background story of the character if any. The `place-of-birth` tag is a location tag, which can be omitted if the character was not born in a particular place. Additionally, the `physical-appearance` tag is composed of child tags that store specific physical aspects of the character such as eye color, hair color, height, weight, and any other detailed features. 
Note: not all fields must be present in a character's input. If fields are missing, the respective XML tags are not included.
