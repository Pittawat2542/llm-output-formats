What is the standard XML structure for character profiles?</s> 
The standard XML structure for character profiles typically includes the following structure:

```
<character>
  <ID id="id" />
  <first-name id="firstName" />
  <last-name id="lastName" />
  <species id="species">
    <name name="speciesName" id="speciesName"/>
  </species>
  <age id="age">age</age>
  <role id="role">role or description</role>
  <background>the background story</background>
  <place-of-birth id="placeOfBirth">locality</place-of-birth>
  <physical-appearance id="physicalAppearance">
    <eyes id="eyes">eyes or other features</eyes>
    <hair-color id="hairColor">hair color</hair-color>
    <height id="height">height in float value</height>
    <weight id="weight">weight in float value</weight>
  </physical-appearance>
</character>
```

In this structure, the `character` element consists of an `ID` element with an ID based on the game's unique character database, and an `ID` element with an ID based on the character's specific ID for each role, species, or other attribute. The `first-name` element typically references the character's first name, although the `id` attribute ensures that the correct name is used.

The `ID` element can reference other attributes, such as `ID` elements for the role of the character, as indicated by the `species` element. There may also be `ID` elements for the location the character grew up, or for the specific species(s) the character belongs to.
