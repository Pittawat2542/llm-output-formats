`game` is an empty object.

`character` is an object with properties that match those in `id`, `first-name`, `last-name`, `species`, `age`, and `location`. Properties that are not specified are just empty strings.

`id`, `first-name`, `last-name`, and `age` are not included in the XML.

`species` and `age` are required properties and can exceed or be "invisible" in this format.
