To generate the XML on GitHub Actions, you can add a YAML file with the code below.

```yaml
character:
   id: id
   first-name: first name
   last-name: last name
   species: species
   age: integer
   role: string
   background: string
   place-of-birth: place of birth
   physical-appearance:
      eye-color: string
      hair-color: string
      height: float
      weight: float
```

Now, when the action returns the XML with the Markdown code, you can save it to a file or use it in your web project.</s>
