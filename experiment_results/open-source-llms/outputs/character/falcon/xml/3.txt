```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<game>
	<char id="id">

```

In the above example, every character is identified by their unique ID `id`. The `first-name`, `last-name`, and `species` attributes are optional. The XML tags `<character>` and `<game>` allow the author to include a description of their character and the game world. In the `physical-appearance` tag, attributes such as `ey-color`, `hair-color`, and `height` are used to define visual attributes such as eyes color, hair color, and height in float value.
