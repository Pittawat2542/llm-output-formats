| Character Attributes                                                             |
| -----------------                                                        |
| id         | character ID                                                      |
| first-name | first name                                                        |
| last-name | last name                                              |
| species      | species of the character (see code below)                |
| age        | exact age or description (years or months)                |
| role        | role of the character in the game or story             |
| background  | location of the character and their history             |
| place-of-birth | location of the character's birth place                |
| physical-appearance | a series of tags to describe physical appearance        |

Tags and their meanings are:
| Physical-Appearance tags (first-name, last-name, first-name, last-name, etc.) - these tags are used to describe the physical appearance of the character, for example, their eye-color or weight. |
| Background tags (character-species, place-of-birth, etc.) - these tags are used to describe the environment or background of the character, their history, or where they were born. |

For example, to extract the character named "John" from the XML, you can modify the Markdown as follows:

```xml
```
<character id="game.character.John">
	<name>John</name>
	
	<species>human</species>
	
	<place-of-birth>New York City</place-of-birth>
	
	<!-- other tags describing John -->
</character>
```

In this example, the name and age information are included, but you can also replace these with any other relevant information.
