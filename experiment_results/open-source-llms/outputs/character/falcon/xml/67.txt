Explanation:

- `<game>` denotes the root element of the XML.
- `<character>` denotes the root element of the character information.
- `<character>` should include only the XML in Markdown, while the content that should be included in a character profile (HTML, or only certain parts of it) should be inside a `div` with class "hidden".
- Inside `<character>`, there is an optional attribute `first-name` with a default value of `${last-name} ${first-name}`. This should be changed accordingly as needed.
- There is also an optional attribute `species` with a default value of `unknown`. This should be changed accordingly as needed.
- `<age>exact age or description` denotes an element that can be changed according to the needs of the character. The code should be placed within a `div` with class "hidden".
- Similarly, `<species>` and `<last-name>` can also be placed within separate `div`s with classes "hidden".
- `<place-of-birth>...` should be placed within a `div` with class "hidden".
- `<physical-appearance>` should be placed within a `div` with class "hidden".
- Inside `<div>...</div>`, `<div>...</div>`, `<div>...</div>`, etc., the XML for the character profile should be placed as-is or modified as needed. 

For example:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<game>
	<character>
		<id>id</id>
		<first-name>first name</first-name>
		<last-name>last name</last-name>
		<species>species</species>
		<age>exact age or description</age>
		<gender>specified gender</gender>
		<place-of-birth>location</place-of-birth>
		<physical-appearance>
			<gender>specified gender</gender>
			<physical-appearance-child>
				<gender>specified gender</gender>
				<height>specified height</height>
			</physical-appearance-child>
			<weight>specified weight</weight>
		</physical-appearance>
	</character>
</game>
```

Note: You can include any CSS classes within specific `div` tags by adding `class="` followed by the class name.
