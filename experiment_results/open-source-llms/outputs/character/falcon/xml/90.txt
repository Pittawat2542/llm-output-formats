## Markdown code block 
Use the `character` tag to specify the name of the character. 
For example, if the name is `Admiral Jack Black`, the code block would be:


```
Admiral Jack Black
```

In this example, only the XML for the `character` tag is displayed, and an empty Markdown code block is used for the `exact age or description`.
