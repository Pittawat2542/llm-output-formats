  character:
    age: 29
    background: 'Born in the small, northern kingdom of Kherse, I was a member of the lower class in life.  With few opportunities available for someone in my station I joined the military to offer me a measure of promise.  As the son of a lowly noble I served as a foot soldier in a military force that saw little action but was rather known for its ability to conquer lands and subjugate the local populace.  This activity resulted in gaining significant wealth and influence, enabling me to offer further advancement to my family.'
