      Born into a rich family without an heir in an upper class city, I am trained to
      lead a privileged life. However, I could not care less for the lifestyle that has
      been handed down to me as if it were a birthright. I feel stuck and suffocating
      and cannot wait to break the chains of my inherited life.

  character:
    age: 10
    background: >-
      I grew up in a middle class neighbourhood in the heart of a bustling metropolis.
      I wasn't very privileged; in fact, I think I spent most of my childhood
      wishing I was rich like the other kids in my class. I had big dreams of being
      successful and wealthy someday, but never thought it would actually come true.
