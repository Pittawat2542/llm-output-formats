  character:
    age: 25
    background: Born into the wealthy and renowned DeVries family, the apple of my step-mother's eye, I was raised in luxury and received the best education money could buy. It wasn't all pleasant, however. I grew up in a cramped and stuffy space; my father, having just one arm, was unable to give me the same level of attention that a mother's touch bestowed. But he always had my back. As a young man, I traveled widely, seeking to discover not only more about myself, but also the world and those with whom I shared it. Over time, I became an exceptional linguist and learned the subtleties of many cultures. It was also on one of those sojourns that I first met and fell in love with Elisabeth Delacroix. She was the first to truly see me, the real me, not the dutiful son who simply followed in his father's footsteps. The two of us spent many idyllic days together, but it was all spoiled by one of my cousin's ill-conceived prank. I discovered that this cousin had tried to force my love and devotion upon my betrothed. I was overcome with rage; my temper got the better of me that day. I made a decision that, for that day, I would no longer be the son of this overbearing father, but rather someone to be reckoned with. I have never looked back; instead, I have pushed my way forward, ever closer to my dreams.
