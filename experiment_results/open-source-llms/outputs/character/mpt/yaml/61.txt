This is a fictional character from a video game called “Uncharted” I’ve always wanted to add a character based on someone in my family so I’ve made one up based on parts of my mom.

This character has a lot of emotional baggage to overcome. Raised in a strict religious household, the loss of a loved one caused a significant spiral into depression and alcohol abuse. This is a problem with most of the “family first” members in the family, so she’s really trying to push some boundaries and be herself more, as she is an adult in the family. She went from being the strictest religious member of the family to the most anti religious in the family, as she lost faith in the religious members of the family when her father passed away.

She is also an avid gamer, in fact that’s how she met her fiance. He’s a bit of a misanthrope, and also is into hacking games and cheating programs, so they don’t really hit it off in that area. Although, her love of games is where she really meets some friends and connects with them on the same level. She’s still struggling with alcohol abuse though, her family is really strict and she’ll have to really beat this addiction before they’ll accept her.
