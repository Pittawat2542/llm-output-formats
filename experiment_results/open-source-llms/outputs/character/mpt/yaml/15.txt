Randy Jackson has spent his entire life in a small farm. Growing up there, Randy had never seen running water, electricity, or cellphones. He was close to his family, including his father, his mother, and his younger brother, Luke. Since Randy's mother and father didn't want Randy to be like the rest of the town kids- who constantly play with modern toys- they kept Randy away from all of the modern technology. Randy was allowed to go on his farmland with Luke to play, but they had to find fun ways to entertain themselves without modern toys. It was difficult, since Randy, Luke, and their parents were very close, but it was the only way Randy knew. Randy's life in the small farm was happy. 
However, then Randy met a girl in the city. 
The girl was from the city, where everyone had the latest technology and modern technology. Randy's parents were hesitant for Randy to be with the girl. Randy, however, was stubborn, and would not let their parents stop him from hanging out with the girl. Randy was caught hanging out with the girl, so his parents put Randy in a nearby building with no electricity, running water, or cellphones. Everyone except Randy was very upset with Randy, except his parents. Randy's father talked with the parents of the girl, and apologized, but Randy's parents were happy.
This is one part of Randy's background story in the video game.
