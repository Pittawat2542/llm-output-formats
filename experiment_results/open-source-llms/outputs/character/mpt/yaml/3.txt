    age: 30
    background: 
      - The second was the most brutal, if the captain’s crew had survived the blast in the first place.  
      - "I was a kid at the time the city was leveled.  I was born a couple miles
          from the coast, my family’s village was in the hills; everyone was fine, but we lost all our cows,"  
      - "I didn’t start being a thug until the next year, when the military came to the island.  They’d have been to our village, too, the captain had
          been a friend of mine.   I don’t know what happened to the rest of his crew, I was afraid to go and look, I guess it’s pretty recent
          and they aren’t buried yet."
