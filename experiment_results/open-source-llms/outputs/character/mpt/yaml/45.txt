  character:
    age: 38
    background:
    - The first 25 years of life were a blur of boredom and disappointment, although a handful of notable experiences provided some relief from the otherwise dreary passage of time.
    - Growing up in a small town in Maine, the first quarter of life was spent in relative obscurity, without a single notable event to speak of.
    - From age 25 to 30 the advent of modern communication technology marked a noticeable change in the pace of life. The internet had a profound effect to the point where it felt like the world was suddenly available in real time.
    - At the turn of the millennium, a string of unfortunate events set off a chain of events that would lead to dramatic political, economical, and social changes around the world.
    - For the next 7 years, the world would be engulfed in a destructive civil war that resulted in the loss of over 100 million lives.
    - At age 38, a new sense of purpose and calm settled over him as he finally understood he survived the war, a milestone he never imagined possible just 10 years ago.
    - Despite years of searching, he was never able to find any record of what happened to his parents and no family remained in his corner of the world.
