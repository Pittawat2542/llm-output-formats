  character:
    age: 32 year old female
    background: Grew up in a high social class family where she has been conditioned since birth to behave and speak in a certain way, even in public. This is often a source of stress within her because she often feels she is judged on how she acts, how she speaks, and what she wears, which she says she just doesn't understand why. She does not fit society's expectations of a young woman, at least what she saw in other young women around her.
