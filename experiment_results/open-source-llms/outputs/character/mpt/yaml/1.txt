  character:
    age: 30
    background: I grew up in a small town in Northern California. I came from a middle class family but had nothing special or fancy growing up.  I was a fairly average student in kindergarten through 12th grade. After high school, I enlisted in the military and spent 6 years in the military.  I was honorably discharged from the military in 2008.  I then went to community college for two years followed by taking a job at a local bank in a management position.  I moved into the city in 2022 to get out of small town living and get away from my overbearing parents.   I currently live in a studio apartment downtown because I am able to afford rent.
