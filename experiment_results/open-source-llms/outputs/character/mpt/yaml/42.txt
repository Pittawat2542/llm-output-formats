    background: Born on the planet Lothal, Tessa grew up with a passion for exploration and discovery. Her parents, who founded the Free Merchant Guild, were staunch supporters of the Alliance. The Lothal system became a target as the first wave of the Galactic Civil War began, and Tessa saw her family and home destroyed. With their ships all destroyed, her parents took Tessa as a symbolic symbol of their business on a ship that would keep them at arm's reach of the Imperials, but not be able to defend themselves. Tessa spent her adolescence on the run, trading in dangerous areas, as well as keeping up to speed on the civil war. One run went too far, and the ship was caught by the Imperial Navy. Her parents sacrificed themselves to get Tessa to safety. Devastated, Tessa threw herself into the next phase of her life - the beginnings of the Rebellion.
