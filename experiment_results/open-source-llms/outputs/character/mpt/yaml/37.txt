### Context
The "character" in Game.Character represents a fictional character from a game. This allows for many characters across games to share the same data without using a hard-coded id.

Background info adds context to a character profile, and for games, this is usually a good way to add fun lore or game/game-world story elements to the character profile. This data is always welcome and encouraged.
