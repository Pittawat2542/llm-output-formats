    character:
        age: 27
        background: Growing up in a privileged life in the countryside of Western Europe, I felt like an outsider from early childhood, always standing on the outside looking in due to my mixed European and African parentage. I always found solace in the arts and in nature in my youth, and was able to be an outsider and observer of social constructs, which helped me navigate my childhood and adolescence with a high degree of emotional intelligence and self-awareness.
