### Explanation
This method will be useful for you to create multiple character profiles which are needed for different games.

First I would need your game information to store in the object and it includes the following items:
* game.character - This object includes all character details that you would like to store.
* game.character.id - This is the unique id which can be anything based on your needs. It will be useful to uniquely identify your character within your game platform.
* game.character.first_name - name of the user in the game
* game.character.last_name - name of the user in the game
* game.character.species - type of the character, for example, human, robot, monster, etc.
* game.character.age - age of the user
* game.character.role - role of the character in the game, for example, gamer, user, soldier, etc. 
* game.character.background - story of the character from the start of the game  
* game.character.place_of_birth - location where the character is born 
* game.character.physical_appearance - it is the array of attributes that stores information of appearance of the character, for example, eye color, hair color, height, weight and gender
