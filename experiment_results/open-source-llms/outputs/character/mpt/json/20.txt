He studied hard and managed to get into the prestigious University of Chicago. It took him four years of hard work but he graduated with a degree in Computer Science. That is when he realized that despite what friends and family may think, he actually wasnâ€™t that great at programming. He continued working on his own projects in his free time though. One day he stumbled across the source code for an MMO he had always wanted to play. After a few months of looking at and re-arranging code John had made a beta version of his own MMO. After two years of beta testing he released the game on Steam and to his surprise, it was a huge hit. Soon after John had made enough money to buy back his parents farm which he has now run with his brother since their parents passed away.",
