In a town known for it’s famous pizza, there once lived a character named “Larry”. Larry was a short man, or so was commonly refereed to in the town. He enjoyed a very simple life. He ran the town’s best restaurant, he had a loving wife, and a sweet daughter he dearly loved. He was content.

One day, Larry was driving home from work when he saw a beautiful woman walking on the sidewalk. He immediately drove towards her. “Excuse me miss, are you lost?” he said to her. She turned to look at him and laughed. It was the most beautiful laugh Larry had ever heard. She turned back to what she was doing, continuing her walk.

Larry pulled up next to her and knocked on his window. “Miss?”
“Oh, hi Larry!” she replied. “How are you?” 
“Fine, I am sorry to bother you but I saw you walking and you looked so lost and alone I wanted to help you. Could you tell me if you are okay or if you need help in any way?” He asked.
“I am just fine thank you! I am doing great! I was just thinking about you. I wonder where you are and if you are okay.”
“Are you trying to set me up with someone?” Larry asked.
“Oh that, you know I was just kidding around!” She said and started laughing again. Larry thought he saw a glint in her eye, something which made his heart miss a beat. Larry was smitten. “I’ll see you around, Miss.” He said.
Their eyes met one last time as he drove away, but they were connected.

It’s funny how life is never what you plan it to be, but that is the best way to live.
