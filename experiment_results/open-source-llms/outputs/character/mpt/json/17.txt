Here is an example from an MMORPG game called World of Warcraft. As you can see the character has a long story with the game:

Raised by the local clan of Darkspears, Blaze was taught to hunt and fish since he was young. He has always enjoyed the outdoors and was taught to respect all the creatures of Azeroth; from the mighty tauren to the cunning night elves and the fierce tauren warriors to the majestic drakes. While living in a small cabin with his parents, and a younger sister, he decided it was time to learn his Father’s art of hunting with an axe. He walked out into the blizzard and watched how to properly wield the weapon. His father’s teachings to respect all living things have been ingrained in him for his whole life. It has always been in his blood. His love of the Azerothian wilderness started then, even if there was no end to the dangers in them. After completing the quest chain to learn the basics of axe-fighting, it was only a short stay back home to prepare for the journey to learn the ways of archery. The family made sure he was ready before he set out on his first journey.",

“Hello! I’m Blaze. I just found this and need to learn to properly use it. Warcraft was released back in 1994, and it was one of the first games in the MMORPG genre. Since then, it’s gotten better, and there are about 5 million people playing it regularly. It takes place in Azeroth, a fictional world based on the planet Earth. It was created by Blizzard, a company that’s really big in game development. They are well known for creating the Warcraft, Starcraft and Diablo game franchises. When I first started learning about World of Warcraft, I was looking to play something that would be similar to the Diablo series of games, but for the MMORPG genre. You can still play that game mode too though. It’s called "realmlock", and you need to be connected to a server in order to play it. You’ve probably heard that World of Warcraft has a lot of story, and a lot of quests to do. It’s so popular that the novelisations have been written and published by Blizzard, and many people have read them. In Azeroth, the people have been broken into 9 distinct races, or "factions" as players call them. The 9 races are: Orc, Tauren, Draenei, Worgen, Pandaren, Gnome, Night Elf, Undead, and the mysterious Blood Elf. In addition, each race also has 3 sub-races, making 33 total. Here's are a list of 5 subraces: Orc subraces: Brutal - an orc with the strength of an earth elemental. Savage - has a high speed and endurance but is easy to provoke into combat. Ironhide - is stronger and more durable than a normal orc but not as quick. Grommash - a large, muscular orc with impressive strength. Ner’zhul - highly intelligent, this subrace has a regal appearance, but can be just as aggressive as the normal orcs. Draenei subraces: Nightborne - Draeneis who have not taken their Nightwell enchantments, so are susceptible to a curse. Vereesa - is a Draenei who has embraced the undead lifestyle. They have a pale complexion, as well as skin that can turn bone white and blue eyes.  Tauren subraces: Bronbron - stands out due to his fur color, which is silver-brown in color. Cenarius - his fur is a silver color with darker underparts. They have lighter and brighter eyes than the rest of the tauren. Keleseth - his fur is black with white spots. He is the bravest of the tauren.  The worgen species are found in the Outlands of Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor in the Northrend continent. The worgen have a symbiotic relationship with the worg pack leaders, acting as mindless thralls for their masters. The worgin are a mix of Worgen and another race. One known race to the worgen's existence is the troll, who have helped the worgen repopulate Azeroth. Although they are considered to be the same species, their relationship is similar to that of the "dog and his master.” In addition to the races: Pandaren (taur-like appearance, blue skin and pointy ears) Gnome (short and stout, with green or tan skin) Night Elf (tall, slender look with blue or green skin. These are the most graceful of the races.) Undead (can look like either Night Elves or Humans, but have pale skin that can range in hue from white to gray.) And one of
