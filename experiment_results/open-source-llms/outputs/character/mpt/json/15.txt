This generated character's ID is the key in the "game" object. For this character, "ID" is "0e65d146812f45d98c0eb12c6adb6c88", and everything from there is pulled from a database and filled in the "character" object.

It is possible that the character does not have the value listed. For instance, if a character did not have their eye color listed "Brown", an empty string would be placed in the "eye_color" key and the next value after this would then be pulled from the "physical_appearance" which is a set of possible keys that could be pulled from.
