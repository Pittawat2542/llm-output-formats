The following is sample text for a full character profile:

Arya Stark is a sixteen-year-old girl, though Arya, being from a long-line of warriors, is physically stronger than most of her peers. Arya is a warrior and a survivor. She is impulsive and headstrong, which has landed her in trouble on more than one occasion. She carries around a needle and thread because she believes you should always be ready to sew yourself back together again after others have torn you down.

A full character profile for a fictional character may look like this:
 
```json
{
  "game": {
    "character": {
      "id": "id",
      "first_name": "first name",
      "last_name": "last name",
      "species": "species",
      "age": "exact age or description",
      "role": "role of the character",
      "background": "background story",
      "place_of_birth": "location",
      "physical_appearance": [
         {
           "eye_color": "eye color",
           "hair_color": "hair color",
           "height": "height in float value",
           "weight": "weight in float value"
         }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Notice how the data in the character profile is similar to key-value pairs. It has the character ID (key) and the character's details (value).

As an example, the following is the output of a character's background story:

Arya Stark was born in a hut in a cold winter storm in the northern section of the Kingdom of Winterfell. Her parents, Brandon Stark, the former Lord of Winterfell, and his wife, Sansa, his sister (and the current Lady of Winterfell), had been waiting to welcome their first child for decades. When Arya arrived safely into the world - though she was born too quickly and had difficulty breathing - her parents were ecstatic. She was brought closer into the fire to keep her warm, the only source of heat in the hut. When Brandon saw Arya, he was ecstatic. He named her "Arya" because "she's red as blood under her skin" and "Stark because she was born in the winter in the cold." While Arya had been small for her age, she was strong. 

When she was five years old, a wildling attacked their homestead. Brandon was killed by the wildling. Arya was with their three young children at the time, but her baby brother, Joffrey, was taken by the wildling. Arya would spend the next decade attempting to find her brother and exact vengeance on the wildling who took him. And she would find her identity in her search: "The Waif."

Arya was not allowed to play with other children in Winterfell as it was considered bad luck, and was forbidden to leave her home alone, as wildlings were constantly on the move and dangerous. At the age of nine, Arya decided to sneak out one evening during the winter with her best friend Gendry. She wanted to see the woods and catch a glimpse of the trees outside her castle. They slipped out of their home and ran along a tunnel in the ground. They were excited to be out of the castle, but were soon found by Maester Luwin, who was a friend of Brandon's. Luwin escorted Arya back to their home, telling her that she would see the trees someday. 

As Arya grew older, she was determined to become a knight to avenge her father's death. When she was twelve years old, her direwolf Nymeria died, and she was devastated. A knight asked to join as her squire, but Arya refused the offer out of stubbornness and pride. Arya was determined to be her father's sword even through her father was no longer alive. Her resolve grew when she discovered that her father was taken alive by her sworn enemy, Lord Baelish. Arya then trained with Jaqen H'ghar, a master of the Faceless Men, and after years of learning, she killed Lady Tyrell. Arya was officially a knight at the age of fourteen. Two years later, she was chosen by a stranger (later revealed to be her father) to become a member of the Night's Watch.
