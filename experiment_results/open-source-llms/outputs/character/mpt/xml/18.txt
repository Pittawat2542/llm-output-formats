Ralph’s mom gave birth to him on the forest floor, and in his young life had learned to take care of himself in the wilds. He lived his young life in the forest with his father fighting bears, wolves, and other predators. He often heard of the village by the lake but never ventured near it. While growing up in nature he learned how to speak with animals, hunt, find shelter in the trees, build fires, and protect himself and his family. At the age of 18, Ralph’s father was killed by another Sasquatch, and while attempting to avenge his death, the bear attacked Ralph. With no other option, Ralph had to leave the forest, and his journey took him to the village. After learning to be a good hunter and the skills of man, he returned to the forest. Over the years, he began to meet the villagers and fell in love with Jessica, a young village girl. In an act of kindness for her family, he decided to return to the village to find work. For years Ralph went back and forth between working at the village and living in the forest. At the age of 20, he decided that it was time to make the big decision; either the village or the forest. He knew that he couldn’t continue life as he knew it and decided to leave. One last time, he journeyed to the village, and asked his boss, Mr. Watson, about his past. Mr. Watson did not want to speak about it, claiming that it was too painful. On his way out, Ralph found Jessica’s family and said goodbye. Jessica, hearing that their relationship was not good with the villagers, asked him to stay. Mr. Watson was told of the situation, and, wanting to end the war, Ralph and his girlfriend decided to move back into the village.
