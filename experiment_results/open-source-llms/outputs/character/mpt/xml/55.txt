Okay, a little more detail about the kind of character I'm making would be great! The more you describe about what makes your character unique, the more I can customize the responses to make it an immersive experience!

A short summary of your character's role in the scenario:

An experienced officer with plenty of training and combat experience at your disposal, you've been assigned to this remote outpost for the last few years to oversee the peaceful relationship with the local indigenous population and the mining of precious materials from this area. 

You're aware that something is not right, and are keeping a close eye on the activity that's happening here. Recently, two members of the mining and harvesting tribe that you have been helping and getting along with were found dead in suspicious circumstances.

Your character's role will be to investigate the situation, determine what is going on, how it has occurred, and act accordingly. Your actions will either resolve the issues and save the day, or exacerbate the problems and put your character and other lives in danger, depending on your choices and decisions.
