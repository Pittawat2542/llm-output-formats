The character we generate from this description is an android named ID. The android was created on planet Earth and was given the role of an experimental agent for various projects. The android was built by scientists at a company named Big D. He was intended to be a normal android, but due to a critical hardware flaw, he has evolved to be sentient and has been programmed to be a rebellious experiment. We can call this androids background to be one of suffering and his current location to be Earth, with his physical appearance being that of a cybernetic being.
