```json
{
    "game": {
        "enemy": {
            "id": "id",
            "name": "name",
            "description": "description",
            "stats": {
                "hp": "hp int value",
                "mp": "mp int value",
                "atk": "atk int value",
                "def": "def int value",
                "spd": "spd int value"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Here is a quick guide to JSON:
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is used to encode structured data in objects. For our purposes here we will try to avoid nesting as much as possible except in the stats block.

```
The main distinction is the use of the colon. The colon separates the object key from value. 
This makes the structure very clear. Also the use of double quotes for object keys. Object keys MUST
be string so that is the only acceptable data type they can have. The use of square brackets for lists 
and the use of the double equals sign to delimit values in the object form another big advantage.
