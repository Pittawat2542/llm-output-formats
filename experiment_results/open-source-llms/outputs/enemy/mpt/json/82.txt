The enemy is standing at the bottom of the arena, eyes peering up at you, the brave hero.  It is looking over at you as you swing your mighty axe down on to where the enemy used to stand.  It then returns with your ax up, ready to attack.

While it's not able to attack at the moment because of a rock blocking your path, it begins to regenerate its health from the rocks that are at the bottom of the arena.  You need to be careful, as it could surprise you from the bottom at any time!
