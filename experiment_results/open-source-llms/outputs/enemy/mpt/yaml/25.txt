```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: atk int value
      def: def int value
      hp: hp int value
      mp: mp int value
      spd: spd int value
```

Description, ID, and name are unique identifiers. It's recommended to store these somewhere. Atk, def, hp, mp, and spd should be unique, too. It’s rare that they’re the same, so it’s common to look them up.
