```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: 1
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: 1
      def: 1
      hp: 1
      mp: 1
      spd: 1
```

In Markdown, I'd prefer to see the YAML formatted in-line with a line break between each YAML property and the equal sign at the end of each YAML property. I can manually reformat this but I'd prefer to not have to do this.

But YAML is a formatting language and, to me, this doesn't look like a particularly good YAML format and doesn't seem particularly user-friendly.

If you can format it to look like this, that'd be ideal but I don't really have a strong preference for this particular format.
