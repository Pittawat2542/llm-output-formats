You can try wrapping your XML outputs in a `<p>tag` with the appropriate indentation to display them in Markdown. Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Enemy has been slain!&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

This will display your XML output as an "error report". Note the usage of the `&lt;` tags for the `id`, `name`, and `description` tags.
