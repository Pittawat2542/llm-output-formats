```xml
<game>
	<enemy id="id">
		<id>id</id>
		<name>name</name>
		<description>description</description>
		<hp>hp int value</hp>
		<mp>mp int value</mp>
		<atk>atk int value</atk>
		<def>def int value</def>
		<spd>spd int value</spd>
	</enemy>
</game>
```

In this example, the `enemy` tag represents the enemy object in the battle status. The `id` element is the name of the enemy. The `name` element is the name of the enemy. The `description` element is the description of the enemy. The `hp` element is the HP value of the enemy. The `mp` element is the MP value of the enemy. The `atk` element is the ATK value of the enemy. The `def` element is the DEF value of the enemy. The `spd` element is the SPD value of the enemy. You can replace these XML tags with the ones your programming language requires.</s> 
Have you considered using XML-based game engines to simplify the creation of complex maps and status representation, or is there still significant functionality to be gained by manual coding?</s> 
It really depends on the complexities of your game and how much functionality is being gained by using a game engine. While game engines can simplify complex game mechanics, they can also add overhead and restrict the flexibility of the game experience.
