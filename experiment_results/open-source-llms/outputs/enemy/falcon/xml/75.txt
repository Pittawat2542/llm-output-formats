As a large language model, I am not able to display formatted text. However, I can suggest that the XML code looks for a "game" tag and then for an "enemy" tag using the Markdown syntax. The nested tags `<enemy>` and `<name>` are not necessary and can be removed if they cause interference with formatting. The important tags to retrieve the enemy's stats are `<hp>`, `<mp>`, `<atk>`, `<def>`, `<spd>`.
