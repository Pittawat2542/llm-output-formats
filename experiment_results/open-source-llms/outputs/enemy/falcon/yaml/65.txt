```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: 1
      def: 10
      hp: 10
      mp: 10
    stats:
      atk: 2
      def: 20
      hp: 20
      mp: 20
```

</code></pre>

Now the enemy information can be found in separate YAML files, and then combined together into a single file with proper formatting using Markdown.
