```YAML
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: 1
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: 7 hp
      def: 12 mp
      mp: 24 speed
```

The above YAML file represents an enemy battle status. In the `game` key, we have `enemy` and an array of objects. Each object represents an enemy, and we can see their description, an array of their stats, such as their `id`, name, `atk`, `def`, and their health `hp` values. The `stats` key in each object contains the stats of the enemy. In the `YAML` above, we can see that the stats are defined as integers or array of integers.
