Game Object:

- Enemy is a list of all enemies in the game. The list should contain an `enemy` attribute with each enemy's information, including a description and classification (e.g. `enemy.type: melee | ranged | magic | special).
- `enemy:` is an optional attribute. If present, the object will have a `enemy` attribute. The `game` object will be placed here, not in this block.
- `name`: is the name of the enemy.
- `description` is the description of the enemy.
- `id` is an optional attribute used for object indexing. If omitted, the object id will be based on the type string.
- `name` and `type` are both optional attributes that affect the enemy's placement and classification within the game mechanics.
- `stats` contains the `atk`, `def`, `hp`, `mp`, `sptl.spd` attributes of the enemy. The `|` characters indicate class names and the `spd.int` attribute indicates speed class. For example, if `enemy.name = "Cinavia"` is set, then any `spd.enemy[Cinavia]` class attribute (e.g. `spd.set.int:10` which is `Cinavia` in our example) can use that class name for its class.

- To build a Markdown object, each class in the ``\n` format is a new block of YAML. Each block is represented within a separate YAML file. The YAML YAML in the Markdown code block is for the enemy object in general. However, since each enemy only requires a certain amount of information, the YAML is only used in the `game` object block that the object is within. In other words, a new separate `\n` block is not required.
