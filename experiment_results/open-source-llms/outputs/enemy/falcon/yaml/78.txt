In the enemy description, you can specify properties such as its name, targetable, and any related items. In the enemy status, you can specify properties such as id, atk, def, hp, mp, spd, and any related items.

In the YAML code block, there is a key called "game" and a property called "enemy". Any items within each block will be displayed in a table format with each property listed as its key. For example:
