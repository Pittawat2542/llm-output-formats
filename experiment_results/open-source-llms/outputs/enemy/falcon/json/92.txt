This example is showing an enemy battle in a Markdown table format. Each row represents a battle between enemies, but there is only one column showing the status of the battle. The `enemy` object specifies how each enemy is defined with its own name and properties, while keeping the JSON structure intact. The `stats` key within the nested `enemy` object contains the values that are specific for that enemy, and they have been marked with double quotes for easy access. The JSON object inside the `game` property serves as a container for the entire table.
