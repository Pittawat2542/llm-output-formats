Create an enemy with the id, name, description, int atk, atk, in atk, stats, and spd


In this example, the enemy has the id, name, description, stats, atk, in atk, and stats. The enemy can also have a specific image or class by adding a property to the atk object and using it as a class name in CSS. The stats section is used to define the damage and ability of the enemy, while the in atk property is used for specific atk values. The atk, in atk, and stats properties are used together to define the behavior and properties of the enemy. The specific values of each property are shown in a JSON object with the same property name.
