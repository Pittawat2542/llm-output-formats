What type of stats does an enemy battle typically have, and how can these stats be accessed and utilized in the code?</s> 
The enemy battle typically has various stats of different types and powers, including but not limited to HP, MP, ATK, DEF, speed, and more. Specific types and powers of the stats that are required may depend on the nature of the enemy and the types of weapons or skills deployed by it. To access these stats and use them in the code, the data should be in JSON format in the enemy's "stats" section, nested within the "enemy" section. Different programming languages may have different methods to retrieve the necessary stats data, and may require additional libraries or specific code blocks to pull together the data.
