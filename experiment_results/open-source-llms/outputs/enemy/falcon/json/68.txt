```
The enemy battle status is:
Enemy:
- Id: 1
- Name: 'Vampire Hunter'
- Description: 'Vampire Hunter is one of the toughest monsters around.'
- Stats: {
    - 'hp': 0, // <-- Vampire Hunter is immortal; HP is not used
    -'mp': 5, // <-- Vampire Hunter doesn't need MP and HP is not used
    - 'atk': 30, // <-- 3x Atk with no need for Acc
    - 'def': 30, // <-- 3x Def against Death types
    -'spd': 5 // <-- Vampire Hunter is so fast that their speed is ignored
}
```

The `enemy` object is returned as JSON within the `game` object. The `name`, `,hp, mp, atk, def, spd` objects are included in the `stats` object. The `id` in the `game` object maps to the `enemy` object, where it's not used.
