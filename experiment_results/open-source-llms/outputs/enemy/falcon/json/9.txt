This code will return a battle status that includes the enemy information as a JSON object. The key "enemy" refers to the name of the enemy, followed by key-value pairs of his/her name and values. The "game" object is then nested inside the "enemy" object. Finally, the "enemy" object is wrapped inside another object with "game" as a key. Please note that the JSON in the code block only contains the JSON code, not the Markdown code block content.
