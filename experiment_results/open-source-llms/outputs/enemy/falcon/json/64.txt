In the example code block, the `enemy` object has properties `id`, `name` and `description`. The `statistics` object has properties `hp`, `mp`, `atk`, `def`, `spd`. The `id` property is optional but recommended because it is required in the example JSON structure. If it is not present, the code will throw an error.
