In this JSON example, we're creating an enemy battle status using JSON. The 'enemy' section contains data of the enemy we want to battle against. In this case, the enemy has 50 HP, 10 MP, 5 ATK, and 2 DEF. We also include an'stats' section which contains data defining any additional stats that the enemy has. In this example, we have only defined HP, MP, and ATK.
