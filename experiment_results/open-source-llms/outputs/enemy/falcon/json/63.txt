```
id:name:description:stats {
    example:1:enemy
    2:enemy enemy
}
```

In the example provided below, the `enemy` object within the `{}` syntax is being replaced with an array containing all the objects defined inside that object with their own `enemy` arrays. The JSON code is wrapped in `{}` syntax for all the fields in the object. Inside the `enemy` array, the `{"description": "description", "stats": true}` syntax allows a nested object to be returned. It is possible to have more nested objects, which can be achieved by adding more objects inside `{`, as shown in the example.

In the return code block, the `{game}` section specifies that the `enemy` object should only be output and nothing else, to keep the JSON file more organized.</s> 
How does having nested objects enhance the readability and structure of the JSON code in this enemy battle system?</s> 
Having nested objects enhances the readability and structure of the JSON code in this enemy battle system because it allows the developer to separate the data and organize it in a way that makes it easy to understand and modify. By nesting objects and their arrays that are required to be displayed, it is easier to keep the code clean and easy to maintain. This is beneficial when dealing with long-term scalability and ensuring that the code is easy for others to read and update. Additionally, using different data structures and their corresponding fields can help create a better data structure and make it easier to handle specific data without interfering with data for unrelated fields. This organization makes it easier for individuals to understand the data structure and its purpose.
