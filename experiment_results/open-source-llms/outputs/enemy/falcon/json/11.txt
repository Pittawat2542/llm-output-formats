```python
import json

# Get status of enemy
enemy_id = input("Enemy ID: ")
enemy_name = input("Enemy name: ")

enemy_status = open(f"{enemy_name}.json").read()

if enemy_status.startswith('{"}'):
    return enemy_status
```

In this battle, we first start with the enemy being identified by the `enemy_id` input. Then, we need to read their JSON status file. If the JSON starts with an opening object in quotes (like `{"id": "id", "name": "name", "description": "description", etc.}) that means the JSON object is invalid or malformed. If it correctly matches the format, we can return the enemy's status as JSON to the user.
