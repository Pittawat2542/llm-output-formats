Explanation:

- "enemy": creates a new object within the "game" object and sets its name to an unquoted string value.
- Enemies can have different stats such as HP, MP, atk, def, and spd.
- Each stat can have their own set of possible values.
- When displaying stats, specify their respective names for the keys, and store the int values in the "stats" objects.
