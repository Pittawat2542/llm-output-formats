"\u201cWe can\u2019t stay here, not with all those beasts out there! This house is a death trap. Come on! Let\u2019s go!\u201d \u201cAwww, I wanted to hear the story about what happened before we got here!\u201d, \u201cThat can wait until later! We need to go!\u201d \u201cBut if we leave now it\u2019ll be dangerous to walk in the forest during the day!\u201d, \u201cI don\u2019t mind walking in the forest during the day, and you can keep up with me!\u201d, \u201cFine, but be ready to run back to the house if we get attacked! I\u2019ll keep the walkie talkie around my neck in case of emergency!\u201d, \u201cOh, right, sure. I guess we should hurry then. Come on!\u201d"
