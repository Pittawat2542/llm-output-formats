"You are in a room, which is a cave. You have a torch in your hand, which brightens the room up a little bit. In front of you there are some stairs. Behind you a door that you came in through with a glowing sign saying 'Enter'. Directly behind you, to your right, is a shelf with different kinds of minerals and a backpack. Ahead of you is a desk, with a computer sitting in front of it. On the table is a map of an island. Next to the computer is a chair. There is a plant on the desk. In the very back of the room, to your left, there are more stairs that you didn't notice earlier as they blend into the wall. The walls of the room, except for the stairwell, are covered in crystals. The floor of the room and the stairwell are made of marble."
