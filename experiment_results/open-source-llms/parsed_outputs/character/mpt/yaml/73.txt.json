Her parents were a little too overprotective to let her do many thing by herself. One summer during her college years, she ventured into the forested mountain for exploring. Her parents were worried for her safety when she was gone. Little did they know, she'd be lost for days in the dense forest until she saw a sleek pack of black panthers with a new born cub. She was rescued by the black panthers and the cub. They were her guides and took care of her until she was found and returned to her community after many days of wandering in the forest.",
