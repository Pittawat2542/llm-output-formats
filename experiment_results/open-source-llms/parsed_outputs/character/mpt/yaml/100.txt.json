He built his first telescope at the age of 6, and over the next couple years began to collect a number of astronomical images. Eventually, he learned all he could about astronomy.\nIn his early teens, he started his first company. Despite the early success, his business acumen had yet to take root, and his first company eventually went under. Eventually, driven by an inextinguishable sense of purpose, he founded a new company, and eventually retired by the time he was 40.\nToday, Michael is a well-respected businessman, is married with 3 children, and is a renowned expert in astronomy.",
