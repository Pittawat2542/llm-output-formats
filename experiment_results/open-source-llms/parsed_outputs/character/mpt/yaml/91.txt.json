He was the first entity to be created by the developers of the game in which he exists, and is described as being an entity comprised of nothingness, the universe, and the unbound recesses of the imagination. A benevolent being, he has spent his eternal lifetime creating all forms, things, and characters within the game. As such, he plays no active role in the game other than being there as the omnipresence that keeps things running smoothly. His appearance is a manifestation of the collective dreams and wishes of those who play the game.",
