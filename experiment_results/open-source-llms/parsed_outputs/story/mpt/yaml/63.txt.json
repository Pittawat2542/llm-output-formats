    "beginning": "Mark decided to pick up a copy of the new Zelda game.  He was so excited, this was his favourite gaming franchise, and the new release promised to be the best yet.  He breezed through the story and exploration sections, exploring new areas and taking on increasingly challenging bosses. The only problem was that he kept on dying.  He just couldn't get past a particularly tough boss, and he was getting really frustrated.  So much so, that he deleted the game and uninstalled the app, hoping that would somehow solve the problem.",
    "ending": "Mark decided to get the new Zelda game again.  He was so excited, this was his favourite gaming franchise, and the new release promised to be the best yet.  This time however, he decided to play calmly and carefully, working through the game one section at a time. He took his time exploring new areas and taking on increasingly challenging bosses.  This way he could really enjoy the game and enjoy it fully for the first time.  And this time, he managed to beat the game and complete all the quests!",
    "synopsis": "Mark had some trouble getting into the new Zelda game at first, since he kept on dying and getting frustrated with the game.  He deleted it and uninstalled the app, hoping that would help him take a more calm and cautious approach to playing.  In the end though, he decided to give the game another go, and beat the game. This time though, he really took his time exploring and completing quests, rather than rushing through it.  This meant he was able to really enjoy the game for the first time, and also managed to beat the game aswell. Overall, his experience with the game improved massively."
