    "synopsis": "The young child, Jane, had been born and raised in the town of Bluffton. She spent her younger years wandering the streets and the forest trails with only her pet squirrel, Buddy, for company. However, Buddy had grown old and passed away some time ago, and Jane's lonely childhood remained unfulfilled except for the friendship of a lonely boy named Joe, who shared in her love of the woods.",
    "title": "When Buddy Left Us",
    "beginning": "One summer day, while the sun shined high and bright on the quiet town streets, Jane was sitting on a bench in front of the library when she heard a faint sound coming from the woods behind her. She followed the sound through a narrow path into the trees, and found the old friend lying on the forest ground, his eyes closed, his fur matted and stained with dirt. She placed her small hand on his flank, and squeezed it softly, and Buddy opened his eyes, and gently blinked at her. Tears filled her eyes as she remembered their long days together in the sunshine and the rain.",
    "ending": "The day would be long, but it was well-spent, and her soul was at ease again."
