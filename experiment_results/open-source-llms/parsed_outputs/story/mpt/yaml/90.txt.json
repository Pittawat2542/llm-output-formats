    "beginning": "The year is 20XX, and we start at a bustling bus station in a small English town. The main character has received word that a ship has arrived from South America, apparently carrying an ancient Inca artifact. When we arrive, a throng of people have already gathered around, with cameras and phones pressed to their faces. There's a buzz of excitement in the air.",
    "ending": "The crowd disperses as we arrive - and as we get close, we get a clear view of two men wrestling on the floor. Blood is pouring from a cut on the head of one of them, as he desperately clings onto the artifact.",
    "synopsis": "As we investigate the scene, we realise that the artifact is actually a head, and that the other man, clearly the victor of the fight, is about to be arrested for the crime. We manage to get him free from custody, and take the head with us. As we try to make our escape, we realise we've made a huge mistake. The police have been alerted, and we barely escape arrest ourselves."
