They try to move, but find\n     that their arm is still strapped to the table they landed on.\n     They notice two men walking into the room, and try to move their head to face them. They don't get far though, and soon notice the\n     men are holding some sort of large axe. The player takes\n     a brief glance behind themselves, and notices a large hole in the wall, with bricks and mortar laying in a pile on the\n     floor.",
