    "synopsis": "After waking to find her village razed to the ground and her parents dead, Amonet must undertake a dangerous quest to find the truth of what happened, and to discover what sort of monster is responsible. Armed with magic and her father's ancient blade, Amonet will travel across the wild lands of the Fell, fighting monsters, uncovering dark secrets, and learning that the answers she seeks may be even darker than she imagines.",
    "beginning": "In the highlands of the Fell, the mountainous region that cuts through the land north of the River, the village of Wold Hollow is a quiet place, blessed with fertile soil and warm weather. There a farmer's daughter named Amonet has been learning how to protect herself with magic, practicing the runes her father taught her, and forging blades with the smith across the river. One morning, Amonet goes for a run through the forests, feeling refreshed after a good night's sleep. As Amonet is running through the trees, she notices a strange beast standing watch over the village.",
    "ending": "In the distance, Amonet can see a group of soldiers riding toward the village. They are accompanied by a dragon and they have shields with the symbol of the beast on them: three serpents intertwined.",
