    "title": "Space Frontier",
    "synopsis": "The world\u2019s first commercial space program has failed.  With no government assistance, it falls to a rag-tag group of ex-military and engineers, to salvage what\u2019s left of their failing company, and find the reason for the failure. What they find is an alien presence on Earth which could very well mean the end of life as they know it.",
    "beginning": "Four thousand miles above Earth\u2019s surface, the commercial space vehicle, Pioneer 1, is in a perilous state of emergency.  With little air left in the cabin, the crew of four are running out of time and choices.  For the first time in history, they are truly alone out here, in the endless void of space.",
    "ending": "Three days after launch, the Pioneer 1 crew is faced with a catastrophic onboard failure in one of the thrusters, placing the ship on a deadly collision course with Earth.  With no communications with ground control, they have less than ten minutes to solve a problem with the ship or abandon the crippled craft.",
    "ending2": "The ground control center loses contact with the Pioneer 1 crew.  Two minutes remain before impact.  With the ship damaged and without thruster function, they have no choice but to abandon ship and seek shelter on the ground in the remote area of the Mojave desert where they had first launched the craft four days earlier.  They make it to the relative safety of the desert, just seconds before Pioneer 1 collides with Earth.",
    "ending3": "Ten years later, a mysterious event has been detected on the moon\u2026 a signal coming from the Lunar Lander.  The government, now back in control of space exploration, sends an exploratory group from the first military unit of the former Pioneer 1 crew on a mission to the moon to investigate.  What they find is a mysterious life form in a deep cave that may be more than what they bargained for. A mysterious being that they must now face to survive",
