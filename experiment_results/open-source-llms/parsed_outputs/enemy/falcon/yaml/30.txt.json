"<!-- YAML comment used in Markdown language to indicate a YAML section, which is needed for the YAML to work.--> <p>The enemy is described in the `enemy` section, and its stats and description are listed in the `game` section. The `stats` section allows us to specify the values of its atk, def, hp, mp, and spd. The `enemy` section is listed within the `game` section so that it retains the formatting of a YAML paragraph.</p>"
