"YAML is a data serialization format developed in Python. In this particular use case, it allows a user to specify their enemy in Markdown format. This is achieved using the `YAML` syntax, which is easy to read and write. The `game` key indicates that we're dealing with a specific enemy in the Markdown. Within the enemy block, we have access to the `name`, `id`, `stats`, `atk`, `def`, `hp`, `mp`, `spd` keys."
