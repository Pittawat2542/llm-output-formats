        "beginning": "The game begins in the ruins of 'Neo-Tokyo', where the protagonist, an orphan named 'Kai', discovers a mystical timepiece. This ancient artifact allows him to manipulate time, giving humanity a faint glint of hope in the face of certain destruction by the mysterious alien race, the Echos.",
        "ending": "In the heart-pounding finale, Kai breaches the Echos' mothership, using the timepiece to scatter the Echos across different timelines. As he breaks the timepiece, locking them away forever, Kai is himself thrown back into the past, back to Neo-Tokyo just before the Echos' arrival. This time, however, he is armed with the knowledge to unite humanity and fight back before the Echos could become a threat, thus, ensuring humanity's survival."
