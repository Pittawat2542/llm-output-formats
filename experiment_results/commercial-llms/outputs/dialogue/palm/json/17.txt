Here is a sample JSON output for a dialogue:

```json
{
    "game": {
        "dialogues": [{
            "order": 1,
            "speaker": "Player",
            "text": "Hello, world!"
        }, {
            "order": 2,
            "speaker": "NPC",
            "text": "Welcome to my world! What can I do for you?"
        }]
    }
}
```
