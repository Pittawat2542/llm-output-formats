Sure. Here is an example of a dialogue in XML format:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
    <dialogues>
        <dialogue>
            <order>1</order>
            <speaker>Player</speaker>
            <text>Hello, world!</text>
        </dialogue>
    </dialogues>
</game>
```

This dialogue has one speaker, the Player, and one piece of dialogue, "Hello, world!". The order of the dialogue is 1.
