			<text>The road goes ever on and on,
			Down from the door where it began.
			Now far ahead the road has gone,
			And I must follow, if I can,
			Pursuing it with eager feet,
			Until it joins some larger way,
			Where many paths and errands meet.
			And whither then? I cannot say.</text>

			<text>Of course you do, Mr. Frodo. But I guess it's like in the great stories Mr. Bilbo used to read to us. Full of darkness and danger they were, and sometimes you didn't want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something, even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didn't. They kept going, because they were holding on to something. That there is some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And it's worth fighting for.</text>
