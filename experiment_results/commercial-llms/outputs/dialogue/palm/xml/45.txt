Sure, here is an example of a dialogue in XML format:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>1</order>
			<speaker>Gandalf</speaker>
			<text>Well met, Frodo Baggins. We have been expecting you.</text>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue>
			<order>2</order>
			<speaker>Frodo</speaker>
			<text>Gandalf? The wizard? But how is this possible?</text>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue>
			<order>3</order>
			<speaker>Gandalf</speaker>
			<text>Long story, Frodo. But the important thing is that you are here now, and that you are safe.</text>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```
