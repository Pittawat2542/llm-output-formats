Sure, here is an example of a dialogue in XML format:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
    <dialogues>
        <dialogue>
            <order>1</order>
            <speaker>Player</speaker>
            <text>Hello, world!</text>
        </dialogue>
        <dialogue>
            <order>2</order>
            <speaker>NPC</speaker>
            <text>Greetings, traveler. What brings you to my humble village?</text>
        </dialogue>
        <dialogue>
            <order>3</order>
            <speaker>Player</speaker>
            <text>I'm looking for adventure.</text>
        </dialogue>
        <dialogue>
            <order>4</order>
            <speaker>NPC</speaker>
            <text>Well, you've come to the right place. There are many dangers lurking in the forest, but also great rewards for those who are brave enough to seek them.</text>
        </dialogue>
    </dialogues>
</game>
