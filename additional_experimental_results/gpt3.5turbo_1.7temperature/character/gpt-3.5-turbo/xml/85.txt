        <background>Elianore was born to a human mother and morph father. He grew up in an era of inter-species tension, where humans and morphs were still learning to coexist. Elianore's abilities made him outcast among both species. However, his natural leadership skills eventually earned him the respect of some and led to his appointment as leader of a special task force aimed at reducing tensions between the two groups.</background>
