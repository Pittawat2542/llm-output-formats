      "The game designer ended his introduction and stepped back to the corner of the room. He was beaming with pride. He still had to fix a few things here and there, but the game had gone over really well. He'd fixed up some of the controls issues, and the stories were definitely more on point. He'd have to keep working on it, but he knew it could be a real hit.",
      "The game designer turned back to the crowd and started to explain some of the finer points of the game. He was in his element now, and he was enjoying himself more than he'd ever imagined possible. He saw the light bulb flip on for some people, and he got a few laughs here and there. It was more work than he was used to, but he just waved it off. His company was about to take the gaming world by storm, and he couldn't be happier.",
      "The game designer started to make his way back to the corner of the room, but stopped for a second when he remembered one important detail. \"The Great Escape\" was a multiplayer game. After his initial playtest, he decided to get some people over for a party to play through the game together. It was the best idea he'd had in a long time, and he couldn't wait to see how everyone reacted."
