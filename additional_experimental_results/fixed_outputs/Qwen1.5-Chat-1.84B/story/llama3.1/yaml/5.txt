  title: "The Last Hope"
  player_character: Maya

  beginning:
    - encounter: survivor_1
      skills: survival, combat, intelligence
    - encounter: survivor_2
      skills: survival, combat, research
    - encounter: survivor_3
      skills: survival, combat, diplomacy
    - encounter: faction_leader
      skills: leadership, negotiation, research
  ending:
    - discovery: outbreak_source
      information: evidence points to an unexpected culprit behind the virus' creation

  player_character_sacrifice:
    - action: sacrifice_maya
      notes: sacrifices herself to destroy the last remnants of the virus and seal her own fate
      consequences: Maya's immune trait is now used as a threat, making it harder for her to survive in the harsh world above ground. She may also be labeled as a liability or a potential threat by other survivors.

  player_character_cure:
    - action: develop_cure
      notes: develops a cure using Maya's rare genetic trait and shares it with the world, potentially saving humanity from an epidemic of The Devouring.
      consequences: Maya gains widespread acceptance and recognition for her work in finding a cure. She becomes a leader in the community, helping to rebuild society and prevent future outbreaks.

  player_character_join_faction:
    - action: join_faction
      notes: joins forces with a faction leader who offers to help Maya find a cure in exchange for her loyalty. This means Maya must choose between saving the world and serving the greater good.
      consequences: Maya gains access to new resources, allies, and knowledge that could be instrumental in finding a cure. However, she also risks being seen as a pawn in a larger power struggle or a potential threat to the factions' interests.

  player_character_game_endings:
    - outcome_1: Maya's sacrifice leads to a catastrophic outbreak, wiping out most of humanity and forcing the remaining survivors to band together for survival.
    - outcome_2: Maya uses her immunity to develop a cure and becomes a hero, inspiring others to join the fight against The Devouring. The cure is widely adopted by the community, leading to a gradual recovery from the virus and the rebuilding of society.
    - outcome_3: Maya chooses to join forces with the faction leader, forming an alliance that helps her in finding a cure while also maintaining her independence as Maya. The alliance results in a successful partnership, but it comes at a cost, potentially putting Maya's life at risk. Ultimately, the player must choose between their own interests and the greater good as the game reaches its climax.
