```yaml
game:
  beginning: the beginning of the game
  ending: the ending of the game
  synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: game title
```
This YAML data is correctly formatted and contains the expected values for a game. The YAML block begins with the `game` key, which specifies the name of the game. Within this key, there are two properties, `beginning`, which represents the beginning of the game, and `ending`, which represents the ending of the game. Both properties have associated YAML content, including the `synopsis`, `title`, and any other relevant data.

The YAML block also contains a single value for the `title` property, which is assigned the string "game title". This value remains consistent across all examples provided in the given example list. The YAML block ends with a newline character (`\n`) at the end to separate the content from the YAML block.

Here's an example of how the YAML data would look like when compiled into a code block:
```yaml
game:
  beginning: the beginning of the game
  ending: the ending of the game
  synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: game title
```
And here's what the YAML data would look like when rendered as HTML:
```html
<game>
  <beginning>The beginning of the game</beginning>
  <ending>The ending of the game</endning>
  <synopsis Game story synopsis</synopsis>
  <title>Game title</title>
</game>
```
Note that this YAML data is not directly represented as HTML, but it can be easily converted into a valid HTML structure using tools such as YAML-to-HTML or YAML-to-XML converters.
