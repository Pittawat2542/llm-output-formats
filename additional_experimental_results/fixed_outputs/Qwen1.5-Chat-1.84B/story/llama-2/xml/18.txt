XML data is fixed as per the provided example. The XML has been corrected by adding missing closing tags for the `game` element and specifying new values where necessary:
```xml
<game>
	<title>The Game Title</title>
	<synopsis>A game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>The beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>The ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```

The corrected XML now follows the correct syntax and provides new values:
```xml
<game>
	<title>The Game Title</title>
	<synopsis>A game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>The beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>The ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```

The output in XML format is:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<game>
	<title>The Game Title</title>
	<synopsis>A game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>The beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>The ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```
