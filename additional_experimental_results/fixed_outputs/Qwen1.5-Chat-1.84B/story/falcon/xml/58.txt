	<title>The Haunted Mansion</title>
	<synopsis>A mysterious mansion sits atop a hill, surrounded by lush forests and towering trees. The house is steeply sloping down to a small, rocky valley below, and it seems to be abandoned for centuries.</synopsis>
	<beginning>As you step inside the mansion, you are immediately struck by the eerie atmosphere that surrounds you. The air is thick with a sense of unease, and the only sounds you can hear are the faint whisperings of ghosts that haunt the halls.</beginning>
	<ending>You find yourself in the family room, where you notice a painting on the wall that depicts a group of children playing in a field. The painting seems to be faded and distorted, as if it was once part of a larger composition that has been lost over time.</endings>
