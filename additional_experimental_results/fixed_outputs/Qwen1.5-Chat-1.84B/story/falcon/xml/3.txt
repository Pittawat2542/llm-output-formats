Original: 
```xml
<wbs:title name="game title">Bopsh</c>wboopshd</game>
```
Fixed: Changed "Bopsh" to a more accurate class type for the WBOOPSH game class. The corrected XML data is now:
```xml
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>A new beginning for the game</beginning>
	<ending>The final showdown in the game</ending>
</game>
```
Now, the XML data is correct and provides the following values:

- Title: "game title"
- Synopsis: "game story synopsis"
- Beginning: "A new beginning for the game"
- Ending: "The final showdown in the game"
