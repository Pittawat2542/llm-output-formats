New values:
- `game_title`: "Title of Your Game"
- `synopsis`: A Game Story
- `beginning`: The Beginning of the Game
- `ending`: The End of the Game
- logo-imgsrc: Replace placeholder with the URL of your game's logo image. This is represented by `<logo-imgsrc>` tag, which contains an `<img>` tag inside it and the `src` attribute specifies the image file to display. In this case, we've used a placeholder value "your_logo_image_url" and specified the URL of the actual game logo image. The `<img>` tag should have the same attributes (title, alt, source) as the one provided in the XML structure.
