Corrected XML data:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>
		<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
		<ending>the ending of the game</ending>
	</synopsis>
</game>
```
New values:
- `key_completeness`: The key 'beginning' is now present with a value of `<beginning>`.
- The key 'ending' is present and has a value of `<ending>`.

Output in XML format:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>
		<beginning>The beginning of the game</beginning>
		<ending>The ending of the game</ending>
	</synopsis>
</game>
```
Markdown code block:
```markdown
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<game>
    <title>game title</title>
    <synopsis>
        <beginning>The beginning of the game</beginning>
        <ending>The ending of the game</ending>
    </synopsis>
</game>
```
Both tags `<beginning>` and `<ending>` are present, indicating the correct format for keys in XML. The `<synopsis>` tag has a value that specifies the content of the 'beginning' and 'ending' keys.
