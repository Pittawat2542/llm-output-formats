```xml
The game title has been fixed and updated as follows:

- `<key_completeness>`: The key  'synopsis' is present, but it is missing a closing tag. It should be enclosed within an XML opening tag to indicate that it is part of a list or set.
- `<key_beginning>`: The key 'beginning' is present, but it is missing an opening tag. It should be enclosed within an XML opening tag to indicate that it is part of a list or set.
- `<key_ending>`: The key 'ending' is present, but it is missing an opening tag. It should be enclosed within an XML opening tag to indicate that it is part of a list or set.

New values:
- `<synopsis>The Game Title</synopsis>`
  - The synopsis is now included as a list item within the `<synopsis>` element.
- `<beginning>The Beginning of the Game</beginning>`
  - The beginning section has been added, containing the sentence "The Beginning of the Game" as the first item in the list.
- `<ending>The Ending of the Game</ending>`
  - The ending section has been added, containing the sentence "The Ending of the Game" as the last item in the list.

Here is the corrected XML data:
```xml
<game>
    <title>game title</title>
    <synopsis>The Game Title</synopsis>
    <beginning>The Beginning of the Game</beginning>
    <ending>The Ending of the Game</ending>
</game>
