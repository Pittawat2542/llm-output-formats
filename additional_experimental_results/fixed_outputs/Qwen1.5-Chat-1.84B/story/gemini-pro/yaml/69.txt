```不断地从已知的列表中选择一个新的值，并将其添加到另一个列表中，直到所有值都被选择。
```python
# 定义一个包含数字和字母的列表
list_of_numbers = [1, 2, "a", "b", "c", "d"]
list_of_letters = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F"]

# 初始化两个空列表，用于存储新的值和选择的新值
new_list_of_numbers = []
new_list_of_letters = []

# 遍历数字列表中的每个元素
for number in list_of_numbers:
    # 使用 for 循环从新列表中选择一个新的字母
    new_letter = list_of_letters随机选择一个字母

    # 将新的字母添加到新列表中
    new_list_of_letters.append(new_letter)

# 打印新的列表
print("New list of numbers:", new_list_of_numbers)
print("New list of letters:", new_list_of_letters)
