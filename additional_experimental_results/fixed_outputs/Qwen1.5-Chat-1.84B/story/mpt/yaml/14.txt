  beginning: "As the credits rolled and the audience cheered, the game designer watched on anxiously from the corner of the room. He knew that his creation had been a hit, but he also knew it wasn't perfect. The controls felt a little too tight, and the story, while original, left much to be desired. Still, it was enough to launch his company into the big leagues, and he couldn't be happier."

It was a pretty modest turnout, but he'd been working on this game for years and couldn't be more proud to finally see it in the hands of the people that mattered most."
