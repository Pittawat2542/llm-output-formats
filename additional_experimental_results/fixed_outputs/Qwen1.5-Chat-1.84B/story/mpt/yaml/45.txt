beginning: In an alternate universe, much like our own, a new drug made from the venom of genetically modified spiders has hit the streets of North America. After only a few months in mass production and distribution by an organized drug-smuggling cartel, the drug has quickly become the focus of the Federal Government.
ending: Your former best friend has now turned into a hardened vigilante known as "Spiders", using his enhanced physical strength to attack all who have killed or abused his beloved girlfriend Mary Jane, whom he believes to be the source of all the problems plaguing his life. He now travels the country seeking out and killing those who do evil, vowing to avenge Mary Jane's death.
