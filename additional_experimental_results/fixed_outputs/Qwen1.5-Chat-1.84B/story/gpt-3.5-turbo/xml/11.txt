	<success>As you approach the heart of the temple, the door creaks open, revealing a dimly lit chamber. Inside, Mal Halifax stands before you, his eyes glowing with malevolent energy. He introduces himself as the king of Aetheria, and he reveals that he has been planning this attack on Felora for centuries. You realize that Mal Halifax is aware of your journey to reclaim the lost kingdom and will stop at nothing to prevent your success.</success>
	<beginning>Mal Halifax speaks with a chilling tone, his voice echoing through the temple's chambers. He demands that you surrender all your belongings, including your magical artifacts and precious magical crystals. You refuse, stating that you have no intention of giving up your heritage or your mission to restore balance to the realm. Mal Halifax realizes that he has underestimated your bravery and resilience, and he becomes more aggressive in his threats.</beginning>
	<success>Mal Halifax launches an attack on you, launching a barrage of magical spells and curses at you.

You feel a surge of rage, and your power begins to grow stronger as you channel all your energy into casting powerful spells. With each strike, Mal Halifax's defenses weaken, and his magic begins to crumble.</success>
	<ending>As Mal Halifax's magic weakens, he realizes that he cannot defeat you alone. He turns to his minions and unleashes a horde of dark creatures, their eyes glowing with the same malevolent energy as Mal Halifax. With your help, you and your allies manage to defeat the dark creatures and emerge victorious from the temple's chambers. Mal Halifax is arrested, and the lost kingdom of Felora once again becomes a safe and prosperous realm.</endning>
