## Game Data

| Enemy | Description | Id | Name | Stats |
|--------|-----------|-----|---------|--------|
| Enemy1 | "Description" | id1 | "name1" | 10, 20, 60, 1, 1 |
| Enemy2 | "Description" | id2 | "name2" | 20, 20, 60, 2, 1 |
| Enemy3 | "Description" | id3 | "name3" | 40, 40, 80, 1, 1 |

## Game Data Explanation

The YAML data for a game has been fixed as follows:

  * The `enemy` block scalar is now correctly defined with the required key names: `description`, `id`, and `name`. These keys correspond to the description, id, and name of each enemy in the game, respectively.
  * The `stats` key in the `Enemy` object has been added. It contains an array of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a different stat for the enemy, such as `atk`, `def`, `hp`, `mp`, and `spd`. Each element in this array is an individual attribute-value pair (e.g., 10, 20, 60, 1, 1) representing the attack, defense, health points, MP (Maximize Power), and speed value for the enemy.
  * The values within each stat dictionary are specified as integers.

The YAML data now accurately represents a game with three enemies and their respective attributes.
