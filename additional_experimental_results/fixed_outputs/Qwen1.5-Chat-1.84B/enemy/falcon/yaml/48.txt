Note that the `enemy` block now contains a dictionary with keys `description`, `id`, `name`, `stats`, and `atk`, `def`, `hp`, `mp`, and `spd`, respectively. The `description` key is represented as a string, `id` as an integer, `name` as a string, `stats` as another dictionary containing the values for each of the attributes (`atk`, `def`, `hp`, `mp`, `spd`). The new values provided in this case are `4`, `5`, `25`, `7`, `8`, and `2`, respectively.
