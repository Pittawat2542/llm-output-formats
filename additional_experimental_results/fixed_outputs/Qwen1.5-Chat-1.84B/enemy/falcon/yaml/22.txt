Here is the corrected YAML data with new values:
```yaml
battle:
  game: 1
  each_round:
    enemy: 1
    each_round_time: 15
    game__rules:
       - rules:
          - name: Spawns
            description: Description of Spawns
            id: Spawns
            name: Spawns
            stats:
              atk: 10
              def: 20
              hp: 20
              mp: 30
              spd: 40
    game__rules.each_round_time:
      time_in_round: 5 # added 'time_in_round' for Spawns round
```
Output in YAML format:
```yaml
battle:
  game: 1
  each_round:
    enemy: 1
    each_round_time: 15
    game__rules:
       - rules:
          - name: Spawns
            description: Description of Spawns
            id: Spawns
            name: Spawns
            stats:
              atk: 10
              def: 20
              hp: 20
              mp: 30
              spd: 40
    game__rules.each_round_time.time_in_round: 5 # added 'time_in_round' for Spawns round
