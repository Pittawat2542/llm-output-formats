```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "This is an enemy description."
    id: 1
    name: "Enemy name"
    stats:
      atk: 50
      def: 40
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
     spd: 100
```
The YAML data has been corrected by properly closing the YAML tags and adding a newline character after the last `game:` block. The new values for `stats` are:
- `atk`: 50
- `def`: 40
- `hp`: 100
- `mp`: 100
- `spd`: 100

The corrected YAML data is as follows:
```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "This is an enemy description."
    id: 1
    name: "Enemy name"
    stats:
      atk: 50
      def: 40
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100
```
