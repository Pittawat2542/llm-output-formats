game:
  enemy:
    description: "A powerful enemy with high stats and a powerful attack."
    id: "01"
    name: "Skeleton"
    stats:
      atk: 250
      def: 200
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
     spd: 100
```


The YAML data has been fixed by adding a missing closing tag for the `stats` object in the `enemy` field. The correct syntax is:
```
stats:
  atk: 250
  def: 200
  hp: 100
  mp: 100
  spd: 100
```
