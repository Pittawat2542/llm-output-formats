Here's the corrected YAML data with new values:
```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: 'A demon from the abyss'
    id: 'Demon'
    name: 'Demon'
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 100
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100
```

The new values include:

- `description`: The demon's description.
- `id`: The demon's unique identifier, which is the key for accessing its stats in the YAML structure.
- `name`: The demon's name.
- `stats`: A dictionary containing the demon's attributes, such as its attack power (`atk`), defense power (`def`), hit points (`hp`), mana (`mp`), and speed (`spd`). The keys represent the properties of each attribute, with values representing their respective numeric values.
