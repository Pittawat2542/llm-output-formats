```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: 10
      def: 10
      hp: 10
      mp: 10
      spd: 10
```


### Explanation:

The YAML data has a syntax error where there's an incorrect syntax near the closing `}` character. It should be completed with `{`. The corrected code block is:
```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: 10
      def: 10
      hp: 10
      mp: 10
      spd: 10
```

This YAML data now correctly represents the game's `enemy` object with the provided attributes, `description`, `id`, `name`, and `stats`. The values for `atk`, `def`, `hp`, `mp`, and `spd` have been updated to their respective integer values. If you need any other changes or additional values, please provide them in the YAML format.
