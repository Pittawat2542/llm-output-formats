```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    name: description
    id: id
    stats:
      attack: atk int value
      defense: def int value
      hitpoints: hp int value
      mp: mp int value
      speed:spd int value
```
In the corrected YAML data, we've fixed the syntax issue by adding a `name` field to the `enemy` object with a value that is not the first character of the string. The updated values for `attack`, `defense`, `hitpoints`, and `mp` are also provided within the `stats` key.
