```yaml
game:
 enemy:
    description: "A random enemy"
    id: 1
    name: "A random enemy"
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 100
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100
      damage: 200
```
Corrected syntax:

- YAML version: v3
- YAML comment: 
    - This is a code block with the YAML data provided between ```yaml and ```.

New values:
- `damage`: 200

Output in YAML format:
```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "A random enemy"
    id: 1
    name: "A random enemy"
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 100
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100
      damage: 200
```
