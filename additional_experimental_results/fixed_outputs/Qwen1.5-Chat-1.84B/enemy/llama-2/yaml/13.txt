Corrected YAML data:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: 10
      def: 20
      hp: 50
      mp: 30
     spd: 40
```

Here, I have made the following changes to fix the incorrect syntax:

1. The `while scanning for the next token` is now `while scanning for the next token (yaml)` using the correct delimiters (`(yaml)`) between the YAML data.
2. The opening curly brace `<unicode string>` has been corrected to `<string>` as it is a valid YAML key definition.
3. The closing curly brace `^` at line 12, column 1, was missing in the original YAML data. It represents the end of the key-value pair for the "enemy" object.
4. The numeric values have been replaced with integer numbers (e.g., `10`, `20`, `50`, and `30`). The `int` value is used to represent the numerical representation of the attributes.

With these corrections, the YAML data now reflects the correct syntax and values for the "enemy" object in the provided template. The updated YAML data will be output as follows:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: 10
      def: 20
      hp: 50
      mp: 30
      spd: 40
```
