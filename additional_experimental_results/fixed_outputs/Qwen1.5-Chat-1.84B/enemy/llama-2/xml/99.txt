Corrected XML data:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<enemy id="1">
			<name Bandit</name>
			<description>A bandit with a big axe. He is very strong, but not very smart.</description>
			<stats>
				hp 100
				mp 100
				atk 100
				def 100
				spd 100
		 </stats>
			<enemy id="2">
				<name Bandit</name>
				<description>A bandit with a big axe. He is very strong, but not very smart.</description>
				<stats>
					hp 100
					mp 100
					atk 100
					def 100
					spd 100
		 </stats>
	</enemy>
</game>
```

New values:
- enemy IDs have been changed to numeric values for proper identification.
- The description of the enemies has been added in lowercase, as XML tags are case-sensitive.
