### Example Output in Markdown code block:
```xml
<game>
	<enemy>
			<id id="21">Troll</id>
			<name>Troll</name>
			<description>A troll is a type of creature that lives in the forest. They are known for their strength and often live in groups.</description>

```

The XML data has been fixed and the `id` element in the `<enemy>` tag is now properly formatted. New values were added for the `hp`, `mp`, `atk`, `def`, and `spd` stats, with integers representing their respective values. The corrected XML data remains as follows:
```xml
<game>
	<enemy>
			<id id="21">Troll</id>
			<name>Troll</name>
			<description>A troll is a type of creature that lives in the forest. They are known for their strength and often live in groups.</description>
			<stats>
				hp 100
				mp 100
				atk 100
				def 100
				spd 100
			</stats>
	<enemy>
</game>
