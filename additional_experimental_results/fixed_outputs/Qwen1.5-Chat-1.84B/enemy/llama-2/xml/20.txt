        <description>A siren is a creature, typically portrayed as a beautiful woman, whose enchanting music or voice lures nearby sailors to shipwreck on the rocky coast of their island. The name may derive from the Greek sirens, who sang to Odysseus during his journey home. In the Odyssey, the sirens were described as having the bodies of birds and the heads of women. The sirens' songs were so enchanting that the sailors would try to get as close to them as they could, even if it meant crashing their ships on the rocks of the island. The sirens would then proceed to kill the sailors and devour their flesh.</description>
