        id: AnotherEnemyId
        name: Name of the second enemy
        stats:

This YAML data has been fixed by adding an array `envies` that contains two dictionaries, each representing a different enemy. Each dictionary includes the keys `description`, `id`, `name`, and `stats`. The `description` key is used to store the description of the enemy, `id` key is used to store the unique ID for the enemy, `name` key is used to store the name of the enemy, and `stats` key has four integer values representing the attack, defense, health, and magic point statistics of the enemy. The keys in the `stats` dictionary are named `atk`, `def`, `hp`, and `mp`, respectively, and their corresponding values are integers. The new YAML data now follows the correct syntax and provides new values if needed, while maintaining the original message's structure. Here is the fixed YAML data in YAML format:
