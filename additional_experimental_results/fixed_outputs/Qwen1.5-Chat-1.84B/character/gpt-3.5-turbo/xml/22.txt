In this fix, I have corrected the incorrect syntax and provided new values where needed. The XML data has been updated to include a `<id>` tag with an `int` value for the character's ID, instead of an `integer`. The `<species>` element has also been moved to its own `<character>` element, and the `<age>` element now includes a `float` value to represent the character's age in years. Additionally, the `<role>` element is correctly included within the `<character>` element, with a new `<role>` element for "Hero" as per the provided template.

The `<background>` element has been updated to include a `<string>` element that describes the background story of the character, and a `<place-of-birth>` element that specifies the location where the character was born. The `<physical-appearance>` element has been modified to include a `<list>` element containing an array of `<physical-appearance>` elements for the character's physical appearance, with each `<physical-appearance>` element containing information such as eye color, hair color, height, and weight.

The new values provided in the XML data are: `id` = 1, `first-name` = "John", `last-name` = "Doe", `species` = "Human", `age` = 25.0, `role` = "Hero", `background` = "John grew up in a small town and always dreamed of being a hero.", `place-of-birth` = "Small Town", and `physical-appearance` = {
    <eye-color>Blue</eye-color>,
    <hair-color>Brown</hair-color>,
    <height>6.0</height>,
    <weight>180.5</weight>
}.
