```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 35
    background:
      description of their upbringing
    first_name: John
    last_name: Doe
    id: 12345678901011
    physical_appearance:
      eye_color: blue
      hair_color: brown
      height: 6ft
      weight: 170lbs
role: Roving Trader
species: Human
```
The corrected YAML data with new values includes:

  * New key 'physical_appearance' to store the physical appearance of the character.
  * New value 'eye_color' to set the eye color for the character's physical appearance, which is blue in this case.
  * New value 'hair_color' to set the hair color for the character's physical appearance, which is brown in this case.
  * New value 'height' to set the height of the character in feet (6ft).
  * New value 'weight' to set the weight of the character in pounds (170lbs).

The YAML data now has the following structure:
```
