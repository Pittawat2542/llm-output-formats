Game YAML corrected with correct syntax and values as per the given template:
```yaml
game:
  characters:
    character1:
      age: 35
      background: African American
      first_name: Michael
      id: M1-2Q
      last_name: Jackson
      physical_appearance:
         - eye_color: brown
          hair_color: black
          height: 6'1"
          weight: 290
      role: Warrior
      species: Human
    character2:
      age: 32
      background: Native American
      first_name: Sarah
      id: S2-5D
      last_name: White
      physical_appearance:
         - eye_color: green
          hair_color: black
          height: 5'7"
          weight: 160
      role: Rogue
      species: Human
```


Note: 
- In the template, the YAML blocks are enclosed in double quotes and separated by commas.
- The `game` block contains a list of `characters`, each with fields for `age`, `background`, `first_name`, `id`, `last_name`, `physical_appearance`, `role`, and `species`. 
- In each character's `physical_appearance` field, the values are represented in YAML as key-value pairs. For example, `"eye_color": "brown"` represents that the character has brown eyes.
- The YAML blocks are not enclosed within double quotes but can be used independently to create multiple character objects with the same properties.
