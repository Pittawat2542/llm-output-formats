New values:
- `id` attribute has been added to the `<character>` element with a unique ID.
- The `<first-name>` and `<last-name>` elements have been modified to include the `first_name` and `last_name` attributes, respectively. Additionally, they contain the correct values for the characters' personal information.
- The `<species>` element has been removed as it is not needed in this XML structure.
- The `<age>` element has been updated to specify the character's age in years or months.
- The `<role>` element has been changed to include a new attribute `role`, which specifies the role of the character.
- A new `<background>` element has been added to describe the character's background story.
- The `<place-of-birth>` element has been updated to specify the character's location.
- The `<physical-appearance>` element now includes an additional `<physical-appearance>` element with a nested `<eye-color>`, `<hair-color>`, `height value`, and `weight value` attributes. The original `<physical-appearance>` element is retained for compatibility purposes.
- The `<game>` element has been updated to include the XML schema definition using the xsi:type attribute, which specifies that this is an XML document with a schema namespace "http://example.com/XML/" and schema element "game.xsd". This allows other XML documents to reference the game schema and ensure proper data validation.
