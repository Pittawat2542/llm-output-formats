The XML data has been fixed with the following changes:
1. Corrected syntax: The `id` element now comes after the `document` element.
2. Provided new values for the `species`, `age`, and `role` attributes, as needed.
3. Replaced `<species>` with an empty string to indicate that there is no species data.
4. Added a closing tag for the `physicalAppearance` element.
5. Added a closing tag for the `eye-color` and `hair-color` elements within the `physical-appearance` tag.
6. Replaced `<height>` with the `floatValue` attribute for the `height` property, which is used to represent floating point values in XML.
7. Replaced `<weight>` with the `floatValue` attribute for the `weight` property, which is used to represent floating point values in XML.
