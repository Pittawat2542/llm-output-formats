The XML data has been corrected with the following new values:
- `<id id="1" first-name="John" last-name="Doe" species="Human"` - Changed `id` to lowercase in the character tag
- `<species>human` - Added a new `species` attribute to the `character` element
- `<age>` has been removed since it is not needed for the current XML structure, so only `<role>` and `<background>` remain. Added a new `age` attribute with a value of "30"
- The `<place-of-birth>` element now includes a `location` attribute to specify where the character was born
- The `<physical-appearance>` element has been modified to include additional attributes for physical appearance, such as `eye-color`, `hair-color`, and `height`
- The `<game>` element is now within the `<character>` tag instead of being an independent element. This makes it easier to access individual characters in the XML data. The `<title>` element has also been added to provide a title for the game.
The corrected XML data is as follows:
