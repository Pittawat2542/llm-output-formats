Corrected XML data:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<character id="id" first-name="first name" last-name="last name" species="species" age="age" role="role of the character" background="background story" place-of-birth="location" physical-appearance>
		<physical-appearance eye-color="eye color" hair-color="hair color" height="height in float value" weight="weight in float value">
		</physical-appearance>
	</character>
</game>
```
New values:
- `id` attribute has been changed to `<id>` for the `<character>` element.
- The first name, last name, species, age, role, background, and place-of-birth attributes have been added as child elements inside the `<character>` element. The `age` attribute is given a floating-point number if it's not already defined.
- The `<physical-appearance>` child element has been updated to include an eye-color and hair-color attribute. A new `<height>` and `<weight>` child elements have also been added for specifying height in float value and weight in float value respectively.

Output in XML format:
```xml
<game>
	<character id="id">
		<first-name>first name</first-name>
		<last-name>last name</last-name>
		<species>species</species>
		<age>age</age>
		<role>character role</role>
		<background>background story</background>
		<place-of-birth>location</place-of-birth>
		<physical-appearance>
			<eye-color>eye color</eye-color>
			<hair-color>hair color</hair-color>
			<height>height in float value</height>
			<weight>weight in float value</weight>
		</physical-appearance>
	</character>
</game>
