		Character Description:
			Jane is a small, scruffy brown dog who enjoys playing fetch with her owner, Sarah. She was born in New York City and has lived with the Smiths for the past five years. Her favorite activity outside of playtime is exploring their backyard, where she can often be found chasing after a red ball or jumping into the nearby pond.
