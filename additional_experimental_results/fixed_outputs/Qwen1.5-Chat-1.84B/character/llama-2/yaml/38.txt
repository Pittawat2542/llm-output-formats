The YAML data has been fixed with the correct syntax and new values as follows:
```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 25
    background: The character is a student at the University of California, Berkeley.
    first_name: Alice
    id: 123456789
    last_name: Smith
    physical_appearance:
     - eye_color: blue
      hair_color: blonde
      height: 5'5"
      weight: 120 lbs
    place_of_birth: California
    role: Student
    species: Human
```


Output in YAML format with corrected syntax and values:

```
