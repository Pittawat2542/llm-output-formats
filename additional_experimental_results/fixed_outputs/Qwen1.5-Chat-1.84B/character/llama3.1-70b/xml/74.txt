			Eira was born to a human father and an elven mother in a small village on the edge of a vast forest. She grew up learning the ways of stealth and deception from her father, a former thief. After her parents were killed by a rival faction, Eira honed her skills as a rogue and assassin, seeking revenge against those who wronged her.

				Eira's parents were killed when a group of bandits attacked their village, killing them in the process. As a young girl, Eira witnessed the chaos and destruction that followed, and she quickly developed a talent for stealth and deception. She learned to sneak into enemy territory, avoid traps and guards, and use her wits and skills to gather intelligence and plan attacks.
