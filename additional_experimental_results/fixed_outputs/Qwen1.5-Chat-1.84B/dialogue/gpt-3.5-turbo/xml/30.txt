New values:
- `dialogue order` has been changed to `dialogue 1`.
- `speaker name` has been added to the first dialogue and replaced with `Player`.
- `dialogue or narration` has been removed from the second dialogue.
- The number of `<dialogue>` elements in the game now matches the count of `<order>` elements, i.e., there are two dialogue elements.
