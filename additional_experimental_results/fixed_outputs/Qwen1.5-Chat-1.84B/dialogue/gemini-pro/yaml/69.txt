    text: And so, the group of people began their investigation. They searched the mansion, looking for clues. They interviewed each other, trying to find out who had motive to kill Mr. Boddy.

      Their investigation led them to an abandoned laboratory on the mansion's outskirts. There, they found evidence of a chemical reaction that could have produced the murder weapon. They also discovered a hidden room containing forensic evidence and fingerprints of the killer.
   - order: 11
    speaker: Detective James Bond
    text: "I have my suspect," said Bond as he walked towards the group. "It was you, Mrs. White."  
   - order: 12
    speaker: Mrs. White
    text:
      I... I didn't do it," she stammered, her eyes filled with tears.
   - order: 13
    speaker: Detective James Bond
    text: "You may have thought you could get away with it, but your actions were caught on camera by the mansion's security cameras. And then there was the fact that you left the scene with a weapon that matches the chemical reaction found in the laboratory."
   - order: 14
    speaker: Mr. Green
    text:
      "What do you mean? I wasn't around when it happened," said Mr. Green, shaking his head.
   - order: 15
    speaker: Detective James Bond
    text: "I checked with the mansion's security system and found that you were on the premises during the time of the murder. You had access to the laboratory and the hidden room, and then you left without leaving any traces behind."
   - order: 16
    speaker: Mrs. Peacock
    text:
      "I... I didn't know what you meant," she said, looking sheepish.
   - order: 17
    speaker: Detective James Bond
    text: "You were the last person seen with Mr. Boddy at the mansion before he was killed. You had access to his room and knew that there was a weapon in it. And then you left without a trace, leaving behind only your fingerprints and the chemical reaction found at the laboratory."
   - order: 18
    speaker: Narrator
    text:
      The group of people were stunned and shocked by Detective James Bond's revelation. They had always suspected that Mrs. White was involved in the murder, but they never could have imagined that she would be the one to confess.
      "I'm sorry, Mr. Bond," said Mrs. White, tears streaming down her face. "I didn't know what I was getting into."
      "It's not too late for you to turn yourself in and clear your name," said Detective James Bond.
      "I... I will," said Mrs. White, looking uncertain.

    speaker: Narrator
    text:
      And so, the group of people sat around the table once more, their faces even more tense than before. They knew that one of them was a killer, but they didn't know who it was.
      "Who is the murderer?" asked Detective James Bond.
      The murderer is Mrs. White, a famous and highly skilled private investigator known for her exceptional skills in solving complex cases.
