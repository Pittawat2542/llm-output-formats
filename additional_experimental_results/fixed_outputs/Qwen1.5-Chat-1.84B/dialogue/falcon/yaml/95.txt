Here's the corrected YAML data with new values for the `order` key:
```yaml
[dialogues]
  order: 
    - speaker: speaker_name
      text: My dialogue goes here!
    - speaker: another_speaker_name
      text: Another dialogue or narration
```
The updated YAML now correctly includes the `<block mapping start>` syntax and new values for `order`:
```yaml
[dialogues]
  order: 
    - speaker: speaker_name
      text: My dialogue goes here!
    - speaker: another_speaker_name
      text: Another dialogue or narration
```

Output in YAML format:
```yaml
game.dialogues
  Speaker: speaker_name
  Text: My dialogue goes here!

  Speaker: another_speaker_name
  Text: Another dialogue or narration
```
