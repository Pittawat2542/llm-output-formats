```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue_order
      speaker: speaker_name
      text: dialogue
    - order: dialogue_order
      speaker: speaker_name
      text: narration
```
This YAML data is corrected by adding a new key `dialogues` under the `game` section, with two associated keys: `order` and `speaker`. The `order` key contains the dialogue order for each speech segment, while the `speaker` key specifies the name of the speaker who delivers the dialogue.
The original YAML data remains unchanged in the code block, but the corrected YAML data is provided as output.
