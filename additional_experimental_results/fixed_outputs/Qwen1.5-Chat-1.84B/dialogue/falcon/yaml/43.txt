The YAML data has been corrected by replacing the incorrect syntax with proper YAML syntax and adding new values where needed. The YAML now contains three dialogue orders:

  1. Order: dialogue order
    Speaker: Gavin
    Text: Hey man. This sucks, right?
  2. Order: dialogue order
    Speaker: Ioren
    Text: Yeah, well it's a bit overwhelming, to put it plainly.
  3. Order: dialogue order
    Speaker: Yuri
    Text: Let us take a moment to figure this out. Let's form a plan of actions that might lead us out of this scrape.

The YAML also includes the speaker names for each dialogue:
