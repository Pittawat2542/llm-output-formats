- Game:
    order: "dialogue order"

    Text: Game's narrative or text on its own, but within quotation marks.
    
Narrative:
- I'm the main character of the game, and I want to make sure everything goes according to plan. 
- To ensure a cohesive experience and maintain immersion for players, it's crucial to follow a structured narrative structure that guides their journey and provides context.
- Here is a suggested YAML format for the updated Game section:
```yaml

    Speaker: "Speaker Name"
    Text: Game's narrative or text on its own, but within quotation marks.

  - Type: Narrative
    Description: A structured and immersive narrative that follows the main character's journey through the game world.
    
  Dialogues:
    - dialogue_order: 1
      speaker_name: Main Character
      text: "Introduction to the Game World"
      description: A brief overview of the game's setting, lore, and characters, setting the stage for future interactions.

    - dialogue_order: 2
      speaker_name: Supporting Characters
      text: "A Brief Overview of Other Characters in the Game"
      description: Introductions or character introductions to key players or supporting forces within the game world.

    - dialogue_order: 3

      text: "The Main Quest or主线任务"
      description: The main objective or narrative arc that drives the story forward, including challenges, rewards, and encounters with other characters.
    
    - dialogue_order: 4
      speaker_name: Supporting Characters
      text: "Challenges and Encounters in the Game World"
      description: Detailed descriptions of obstacles, enemies, puzzles, or other challenges players may face during their journey through the game world, along with any potential encounters with NPCs or supernatural forces.
    
    - dialogue_order: 5
      speaker_name: Side Quests or Supporting Missions
      text: "Additional Stories and Side-Effects"
      description: Short stories or side quests that offer additional content or experiences for players, such as side missions, mini-games, or hidden secrets within the game world.

This updated YAML structure provides a clear narrative structure with distinct dialogue orders that guide the player's journey. The Type field specifies that the Narrative section is a structured and immersive narrative rather than a standalone text, allowing for more engaging storytelling. Each Dialogue entry includes a dialogue_order number to maintain consistency across multiple sections in the game YAML.
