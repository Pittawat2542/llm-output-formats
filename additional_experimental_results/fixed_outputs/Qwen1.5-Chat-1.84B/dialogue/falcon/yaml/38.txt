Here is the corrected YAML data with new values added where needed:
```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text: "Good morning, it's a great day!"
    options: ["Good morning, it's a great day!", "Great, you've had a great day!"]
    voice: [speakers.name, "The voice of the game"]

- blank
- blank
- "Hello, world!!" - "Hello, world!"
- ==Hello, world!!== - "Goodbye, world!"

- dialogue with "Hi, how are you today?" - "Hi, I'm good!"
    options: ["How are you?", "I'm doing well. How about you?"]
    voice: [speakers.name]

- "Good morning, it's a great day!" - "Awesome, you've had a great morning!"
    text: "A beautiful morning to start the day!"
    options: ["Beautiful morning", "Great morning"]
    voice: [speakers.name]

- "Gotta run. See ya later!" - "Bye! Have a nice day!"
    text: "Goodbye, see you soon!"
    options: ["See you soon", "Bye for now"]
    voice: [speakers.name]
```

The corrected YAML data includes:
1. A new sequence called `dialogues` with an order of ` dialogue order`, speaker `speaker name`, and text "Good morning, it's a great day!". The options for each dialogue are "Good morning, it's a great day!", "Great, you've had a great day!". The voice for the `dialogue` is the name of the speaker.
2. The original list has been replaced with an array called `dialogues`, where each element is a dictionary containing the following keys:
   - `order`: The order in which the dialogue should be spoken.
   - `speaker`: The name of the speaker who will say the dialogue.
   - `text`: The text to be said in the dialogue.
   - `options`: An array of strings that contains the options for the dialogue (e.g., "Good morning, it's a great day!", "Great, you've had a great day!").
   - `voice`: A string indicating the voice used by the speaker in the dialogue.

The correct YAML data is now:
```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text: "Good morning, it's a great day!"
    options: ["Good morning, it's a great day!", "Great, you've had a great day!"]
    voice: [speakers.name, "The voice of the game"]

- blank
- blank
- "Hello, world!!" - "Hello, world!"
- ==Hello, world!!== - "Goodbye, world!"

- dialogue with "Hi, how are you today?" - "Hi, I'm good!"
    options: ["How are you?", "I'm doing well. How about you?"]
    voice: [speakers.name]

- "Good morning, it's a great day!" - "Awesome, you've had a great morning!"
    text: "A beautiful morning to start the day!"
    options: ["Beautiful morning", "Great morning"]
    voice: [speakers.name]

- "Gotta run. See ya later!" - "Bye! Have a nice day!"
    text: "Goodbye, see you soon!"
    options: ["See you soon", "Bye for now"]
    voice: [speakers.name]
