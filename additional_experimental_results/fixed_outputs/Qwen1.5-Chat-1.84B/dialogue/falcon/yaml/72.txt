Corrected YAML data with new values:

```yaml
Alice: 
- order: dialogue_order
  dialogue:
    order: 1
    speaker: Alice
    text: The day is sunny. 
Bob: 
- order: speaker_order_of_dialogue
  dialogue:
    order: 2
    speaker: Bob
    text: This is a nice speech.
```

Output in YAML format:

```yaml
Alice:
  - order: dialogue_order
    dialogue:
      - order: 1
        speaker: Alice
        text: The day is sunny.
Bob:
  - order: speaker_order_of_dialogue
    dialogue:
      - order: 2
        speaker: Bob
        text: This is a nice speech.
```
