Corrected YAML data:
```
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker:
         - name: Speaker 1
      text: Dialogue 1
``` 
New values added:
1. `order: dialogue order`: The `order` field now specifies the sequence of dialogues in the game.
2. `speaker: speaker name`: The `speaker` field includes a new value for the speaker's name, represented by an array `[name]`. In this case, `name` is "Speaker 1".
3. `text: dialogue or narration`: The `text` field specifies that the dialogues are either dialogues or narrations, with a default value of "dialogue". If you want to specify a different text for each type of dialogue, you can update this field to include an array `[type]`. For example:
```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker:
         - name: Speaker 1
        text: Dialogue 1
        type: narration
      text: Dialogue 2
```
In the corrected data, `dialogue` and `narration` are represented as separate entities within the `text` field. If you want to specify different texts for each type of dialogue, you can provide an array of strings `[type]`.
