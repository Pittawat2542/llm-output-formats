Corrected XML data with new values:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
			<dialogue>
				<order>dialogue order</order>
				<speaker>speaker name</speaker>
				<text>dialogue or narration</text>
			</dialogue>
		</dialogues>
		<narration>
			<narrative text goes here</narrative>
		</narration>
	</game>
```
New values:
1. `dialogues`: a list containing two `<dialogue>` elements, each with the following attributes:
   - `order` (string): the order in which the dialogue is presented (e.g., 1, 2, etc.)
   - `speaker` (string): the name of the speaker who says the dialogue
   - `text` (string): the text of the dialogue
2. `narration`: a single `<narrative>` element containing the narrative text.
Note: The `Narration` element is not used in the original XML data, so no new attributes were added to it. If you want to add additional elements or attributes for the `narration`, you can do that by replacing the existing `<narration>` element with the desired structure.
