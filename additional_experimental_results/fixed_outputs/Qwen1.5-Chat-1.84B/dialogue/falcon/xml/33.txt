Corrected XML data:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
			<dialogue>
				<order>dialogue order</order>
				<speaker>name</speaker>
				<text>dialogue or narration</text>
			</dialogue>
			<dialogue>
				<order>dialogue order</order>
				<speaker>name</speaker>
				<text>dialogue or narration</text>
			</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```
New values:
- `<order>` has been replaced with `dialogue order`, which is a valid token and specifies the order in which the dialogue should appear.
- `<speaker>` has been replaced with `name`, which is a common identifier for speakers in XML.
- `<text>` has been replaced with `content of conversation`, which is the actual text of the dialogue.
The corrected XML data now follows the structure provided by the template and includes all the necessary elements. The output in XML format is:
```xml
<game>
	<dialogues>
			<dialogue order="dialogue 1">
				<speaker>name</speaker>
				<text>dialogue content 1</text>
			</dialogue>
			<dialogue order="dialogue 2">
				<speaker>name</speaker>
				<text>dialogue content 2</text>
			</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```
