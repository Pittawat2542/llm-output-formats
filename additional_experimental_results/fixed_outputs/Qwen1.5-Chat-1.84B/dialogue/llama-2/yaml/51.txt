game:
  dialogues:
   - order: dialogue order
    speaker: "Alice"
    text: "The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland"

## Notes
In the original YAML data, there was a syntax error at line 6, column 1. The character '`' cannot start any token because it is used as a backslash character within the string literal `^`. This has been fixed by replacing the character with `Alice` to correctly specify the speaker.

Here's the corrected YAML data with the new values:
```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: dialogue order
    speaker: "Alice"
    text: "The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland"
```
