The corrected YAML data for the given message is:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name

- `speaker`: The name of the person delivering the dialogue.
- `text`: The actual text or narration that should be associated with the dialogue.

Output in YAML format:
```
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
```
