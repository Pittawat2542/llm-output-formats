Explanation:
1. The XML declaration `<xml version="1.0" />` has been added at the beginning of the document.
2. The root element `game` has been added with a child element `<dialogues>`.
3. Each dialogue is represented as a nested `dialogue` element, with the following attributes:
	- `<order>`: The order number for the dialogue.
	- `<speaker>`: The speaker name associated with the dialogue.
	- `<text>`: The text of the dialogue (if applicable). In this case, it's not specified in the provided template, so no value is given. However, if there were a dialogue that required a specific speaker or text, it could be included here.
4. Each nested `dialogue` element has a closing `<dialogue>` tag.
5. There are two `dialogues` elements within the root `game` element: one for "John Smith" and one for "Just a sec." In this case, no value is given for the second `dialogue`, but it can be specified if needed by replacing `<dialogue>...</dialogue>` with `<dialogue speaker="john smith">...</dialogue>`.
