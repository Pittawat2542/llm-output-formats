Corrected XML data:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<game>
	<id>id</id>
	<title>quest title</title>
	<objective>quest objective</objective>
	<description>quest description</description>
	<reward>quest reward</reward>
	<quest-giver>quest giver</quest-giver>
	<tasks>
			<task>
				<order>Task Order 1</order>
				<objective>Task Objective 1</objective>
				<description>Task Description 1</description>
				<location>Task Location 1</location>
			</task>
			<task>
				<order>Task Order 2</order>
				<objective>Task Objective 2</objective>
				<description>Task Description 2</description>
				<location>Task Location 2</location>
			</task>
			<task>
				<order>Task Order 3</order>
				<objective>Task Objective 3</objective>
				<description>Task Description 3</description>
				<location>Task Location 3</location>
			</task>
	</tasks>
</game>
```
New values:
- `id` is now `<id>` (no need to specify the type attribute)
- `title` has been changed to `<title>` (no space before and no space after)
- `objective` has been changed to `<objective>` (no space before, no space after, no comma at the end)
- `description` has been changed to `<description>` (no space before or after)
- `reward` is now `<reward>` (no need to specify the type attribute)
- `quest-giver` has been added as an attribute with a value of `<quest-giver>` (no space before, no space after)
- `<tasks>` has been removed since there are only three tasks
The updated XML data with the corrected syntax and new values is:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<game>
	<id id="id">id</id>
	<title quest title="quest title" objective="quest objective" description="quest description" reward="quest reward" quest-giver="quest giver" />
	<tasks>
		<task order="Task Order 1" objective="Task Objective 1" description="Task Description 1" location="Task Location 1"/>
		<task order="Task Order 2" objective="Task Objective 2" description="Task Description 2" location="Task Location 2"/>
		<task order="Task Order 3" objective="Task Objective 3" description="Task Description 3" location="Task Location 3"/>
	</tasks>
</game>
```
