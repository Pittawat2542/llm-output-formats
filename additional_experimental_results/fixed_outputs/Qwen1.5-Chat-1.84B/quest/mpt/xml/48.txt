Explanation:
- The `quest-giver` element has been replaced with a single `quest-giver` tag, which contains the value of the key "quest giver".
- A new `tasks` element is added with two child elements: `task` and `task`. Each `task` element now has an order attribute, an objective attribute, a description attribute, a location attribute, and a new `<location>` element to store the task's location.
- The XML data now includes the missing value for the key "quest-giver". The values for `order`, `objective`, `description`, `location`, and `task` have been added accordingly.
