Corrected XML data:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game id="id">
    <title>quest title</title>
    <objective>quest objective</objective>
    <description>quest description</description>
    <reward>quest reward</reward>
    <quest-giver>quest giver</quest-giver>
    <tasks>
        <task order="1">
            <objective>task objective 1</objective>
            <description>task description 1</description>
            <location>task location 1</location>
        </task>
        <!-- Add more tasks as needed -->
    </tasks>
</game>
```
Output in XML format:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<game id="id">
    <title>quest title</title>
    <objective>quest objective</objective>
    <description>quest description</description>
    <reward>quest reward</reward>
    <quest-giver>quest giver</quest-giver>
    <tasks>
        <task order="1">
            <objective>task objective 1</objective>
            <description>task description 1</description>
            <location>task location 1</location>
        </task>
        <!-- Add more tasks as needed -->
    </tasks>
</game>
```
The XML data has been fixed by adding a new task element within the `tasks` tag, with an ordered attribute of '1' and including the necessary objectives, descriptions, and locations. If there are additional tasks that need to be added, simply add more `task` elements with appropriate attributes and nested `tasks` tags as needed.
