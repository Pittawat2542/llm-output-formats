<game id="130845" title="Quest: The Power of Three"objective="Acquire three ancient artifacts">
  <description>You have just received a letter from your grandfather, stating that he has located the location of an artifact that has been lost for more than 300 years. As a young man he and his friends discovered this incredible item. Now much older and on his deathbed, he asked you to search for the object to prove once and for all that it really exists. The artifact is a magical staff that grants the user great power over time and space. There are three locations around the world where the staff was supposedly left. Your grandfather has only been able to identify two of these locations. With the help of your friends, you will need to find all three objects if you are ever to understand why your grandfather kept this secret for so many years. There is, unfortunately, a great evil that seeks the staff and has traveled through time to search for it as well. This ancient evil has already sent one of their spies back to the present day with the goal of stealing the staff. You will have to act quickly if you want to find all three artifacts before it is too late.</description>
