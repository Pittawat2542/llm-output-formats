The XML has been fixed by adding a new `tasks` element with the correct attributes for each task. The `<order>` attribute is set to 1 and 2 in both tasks, and the `<objective>` and `<description>` attributes have been replaced with their respective values. The `<location>` attribute is also set correctly for each task. The XML now represents a game with the specified game ID, title, objective, description, reward, quest giver, and tasks with two tasks: one task with an order of 1, objective of 1, description "task description" and location "location", and another task with an order of 2, objective of 2, description "task description" and location "location".
