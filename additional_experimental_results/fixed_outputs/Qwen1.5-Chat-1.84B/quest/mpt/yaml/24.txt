Here is the corrected YAML data with new values:

```yaml
game:
  description: quest description
  id: id
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
   - task_description: task description
     location: task_location
     objective: task_objective
     order: task_order
  title: quest_title

tasks:
- task_description: task description
  location: task_location
  objective: task_objective
  order: task_order
``` 

Updated values:

1. `description` field to `task_description`: The correct field for the "description" in the tasks section.
2. `location` field to `task_location`: Changed `"task"` to `"task_location"` as it is a common name for locations.
3. `objective` field to `task_objective`: Updated `objective` to `task_objective`.
4. `order` field to `task_order`: The correct order of the tasks in the list.

Output in YAML format:
```yaml
game:
  description: quest description
  id: id
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
    - task_description: task description
      location: task_location
      objective: task_objective
      order: task_order
  title: quest_title

tasks:
- task_description: task description
  location: task_location
  objective: task_objective
  order: task_order
```
