The corrected XML data with new values includes the following:

- `<quest-giver>` now has a value of `Merlin the Magician`.
- The number of tasks is increased from 1 to 2. The first task is named "Find the Enchanted Forest" and requires finding the entrance to the forest according to King Arthur's map.
- The location for the second task is still unknown, but it can be added as a new `<task>` element with an `order` attribute of `2`. For example:

```xml
<tasks>
    <task order="2">
        <objective>Find the Crystal Geyser</objective>
        <description>Your second task is to locate the crystal geyser, which is said to be hidden deep within the vast Grand Canyon. Talk to the local Native Americans and follow their guidance to find the ancient structure.</description>
        <location>The Grand Canyon</location>
    </task>
</tasks>
```
Please note that this XML data assumes the existence of a `<game>` element with an `id` attribute of `123456`, which corresponds to the original XML message you provided. If there is no such element in the provided XML, the correct game ID would be used instead of `<game>` with `id="123456"`.
