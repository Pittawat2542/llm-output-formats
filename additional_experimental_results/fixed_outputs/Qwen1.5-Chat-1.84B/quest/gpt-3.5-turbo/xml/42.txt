The XML data has been fixed with the following changes:
- Corrected the syntax for the `<quest-giver>` element by using lowercase letters.
- Added a new `<task order="3"` element for the third task, which specifies that the objective is to defeat the guardian.
- Replaced `<location>` tags with `<description>` elements within each `task` task to provide more details about the location. The updated location is `<location>The Temple of Shadows</location>`.
- Added a new `<reward>` element for the reward, specifying that it includes an ancient artifact and gold coins.

The corrected XML data now follows the provided template with the fixed syntax and values: ```xml version="1.0" ?>
