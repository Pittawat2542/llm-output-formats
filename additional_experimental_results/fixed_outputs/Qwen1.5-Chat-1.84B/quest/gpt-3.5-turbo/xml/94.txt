The XML data has been fixed, and new values have been added where needed:

1. The `quest-giver` element now includes a value for Captain Redbeard.
2. A new `<task>` element with an order of 3 has been added to represent the task that requires defeating the guardian beast.

The original message remains unchanged between ```xml and ``` but has been updated in XML format. The output is:
