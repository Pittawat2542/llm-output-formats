Corrected XML data:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<id>123456789</id>
	<title>quest title</title>
	<objective>quest objective</objective>
	<description>quest description</description>
	<reward>quest reward</reward>
	<quest-giver>quest giver</quest-giver>
	<tasks>
			<task id="1" order="1" objective="task objective" description="task description" location="task location"/>
			<task id="2" order="2" objective="task objective" description="task description" location="task location"/>
	</tasks>
</game>
```
The XML data has been fixed by correcting the syntax, adding a `id` attribute to each `<task>` element, and using lowercase letters for identifiers. The new values for task `id` are 1 and 2, and the order of tasks is 1, 2, and so on. Additionally, I have added the `location` attribute to the `<task>` elements to specify the location where each task is located.
