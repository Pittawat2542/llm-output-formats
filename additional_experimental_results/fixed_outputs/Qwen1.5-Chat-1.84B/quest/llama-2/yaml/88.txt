Corrected YAML data:
```
game:
  description: "Quest Description"
  id: 1
  objective: "Quest Objective"
  quest_giver: "Quest Giver"
  reward: "Reward"
  tasks:
    - description: Task Description
      location: Task Location
      objective: Task Objective
      order: Task Order
    - description: Another task description
      location: Another Task Location
      objective: Another Task Objective
      order: Another Task Order
  title: Quest Title
```
Output in YAML format:
```yaml
game:
  description: "Quest Description"
  id: 1
  objective: "Quest Objective"
  quest_giver: "Quest Giver"
  reward: "Reward"
  tasks:
    - description: Task Description
      location: Task Location
      objective: Task Objective
      order: Task Order
    - description: Another task description
      location: Another Task Location
      objective: Another Task Objective
      order: Another Task Order
  title: Quest Title
```
Note: The new values provided are for the `description`, `location`, `objective`, `order`, and `title` fields in the YAML data. If there were additional required fields or values needed, they would be specified in the respective placeholders (e.g., `task_description`, `task_location`, `task_objective`, `task_order`, etc.) for the tasks section of the quest.
