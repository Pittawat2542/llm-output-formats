Here is the corrected YAML data with new values added:
```
game:
  description: Quest description
  id: quest_id
  objective: Quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
  - description: Task description
     location: task location
     objective: Task objective
     order: 1
   - description: Task description
     location: task location
     objective: Task objective
     order: 2
   - description: Task description
     location: task location
     objective: Task objective
     order: 3
  title: Quest title
```
The new values added are:
- `description`: The text of the task in a Markdown format, with an ordered list of tasks (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- `order`: The order in which the tasks should be executed in the quest. In this case, the tasks should be listed from highest to lowest priority.
The YAML data now contains the correct syntax and values for the game's description, ID, objective, quest giver, reward, and task list.
