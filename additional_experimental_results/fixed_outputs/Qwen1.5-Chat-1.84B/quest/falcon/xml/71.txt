In this modified XML code, I have fixed the syntax errors and added new values for the `quest-giver` element. The `id` attribute is now set to `1`, which corresponds to the game ID `1`. The `title` element has been updated to reflect the new quest title "Example Quest". The `objective` element remains unchanged, and the description element contains a new line break to separate it from the rest of the description.

The XML data has been formatted using the `<game>` element to group related tasks together. Each task is represented by an `<task>` element with its own unique `id`, `order`, objective, description, location, and reward elements.

To generate and return the Markdown in XML format using xargs, the following command can be used:

```bash
xargs -9 -s -N 1 -o output.xml -r quest-info.md < input.xml
```
In this command, replace `<input.xml>` with the path to your XML file containing the original XML data. The `-N` option specifies the maximum number of arguments passed to xargs, which defaults to 0 in this case.

The `xml` output is then redirected to a new file named "output.xml". The `-r` option specifies that the generated Markdown should be outputted as a separate file rather than modifying the input XML. This allows you to keep your original XML data intact while generating the HTML output for easy editing and sharing.
