Corrected YAML data:
```yaml
game:
  description: quest title
  id: 123456
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
  - task_1: description of task 1
     location: task location 1
     objective: task objective 1
     order: 1
   - task_2: description of task 2
     location: task location 2
     objective: task objective 2
     order: 2
   - task_3: description of task 3
     location: task location 3
     objective: task objective 3
     order: 3
```
The corrected YAML data includes the following values:

- `game`: mapping with a key-value pair where the key is `"description"` and the value is `"quest title"`.
- `id`: an integer value of `123456`, which represents the unique identifier for the game.
- `objective`: a string value of `"quest objective"`, indicating the main goal or objective of the quest.
- `quest_giver`: a mapping with a key-value pair where the key is `"quest giver"` and the value is a reference to an object (e.g., a person or entity) who created or authorized the quest.
- `reward`: a string value of `"quest reward"`, specifying the type and amount of rewards given for completing the quest.
- `tasks`: another mapping with a key-value pair where the key is `"task"` and the value is a list of objects (e.g., dictionaries or arrays) representing the various tasks required to complete the quest. Each task object contains the following keys:

  * `description`: a string value describing the specific task.
  * `location`: a string value specifying the location where the task takes place.
  * `objective`: a string value indicating the main objective of the task.
  * `order`: an integer value representing the order in which the task should be completed.

In the corrected data, each quest has a unique identifier (`id`) and a description, objective, reward, and a list of tasks (each with its own description, location, objective, and order). The original Markdown text is also included in the YAML format to showcase how the updated data is rendered.
