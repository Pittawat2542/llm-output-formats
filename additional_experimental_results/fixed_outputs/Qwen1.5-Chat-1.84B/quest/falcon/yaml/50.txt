Game Quest
## Quest Information

### Description
The game quest is about retrieving an ancient forgotten temple located within a dark, misty forest. The objective is to introduce the player to the ancient, forgotten temple and complete various tasks to achieve success.

#### ID
The quest ID is `introduction-id`. This code block represents the value of the `id` field in YAML format with the correct syntax.

### Objective
The quest objective is to introduce the player to the ancient, forgotten temple. The required requirements for completing the quest are as follows:

- **Successful ID**: `success-rate([%.0f]%).`
This code block sets an optional `success_rate` parameter and assigns it a value of 50% (represented by `%0f%`). The `success-rate` is used to calculate the success rate based on the number of successful objectives completed. The percentage format ensures that the result is stored in a decimal and can be easily converted to a percentage using string formatting or a mathematical function.

#### Giver
The quest-giver is "quest-giver: guide". This code block represents the value of the `giver` field in YAML format with the correct syntax.

### Reward
The reward for completing the quest will be `player-gains-magic-item`. This code block sets an optional `reward` parameter and assigns it a value of 400 gold coins. The `reward` parameter is used to represent the monetary value of the reward received by the player when they complete the quest.

#### Location

By following the YAML format, the corrected data is now stored in a structured manner for game quests. The `id` field contains an ID for the quest, which can be referenced by other parts of the game's logic and assets. The objectives are organized into four distinct objectives with their respective requirements for success. The `giver` field specifies the role of the quest-giver who will provide guidance and resources throughout the quest. The reward parameter includes a monetary value that can be used in later game events or trade mechanics to incentivize completing the quest. Lastly, the location and objectives fields specify the specific locations and tasks required for successfully completing the quest, while the rewards field provides the monetary benefit of achieving each objective.
