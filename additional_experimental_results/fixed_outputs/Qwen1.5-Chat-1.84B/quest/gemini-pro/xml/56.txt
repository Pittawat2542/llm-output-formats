```xml
The XML data has been fixed with the following changes:
- The `<quest-giver>` element was added to specify the name of the quest giver.
- The `<task>` element within each task was updated to include an `order` and `objective` value, as well as a `description` and `location` value. This adds clarity to each task's purpose and where it takes place in the game world.
- The `<tasks>` element has been restructured to contain multiple tasks separated by `<task>` tags, with appropriate order numbers (`1`, `2`, `3`, `4`) indicating their respective objectives.
The XML data now follows the correct XML syntax and provides new values for the quest giver, task objects, and locations. The output in XML format is:
