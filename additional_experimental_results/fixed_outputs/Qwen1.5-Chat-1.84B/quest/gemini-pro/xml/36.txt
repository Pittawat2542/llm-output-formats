The corrected XML data includes the following new values:
- `quest_giver` now has a value of "King Edmund", indicating that the quest giver is the king.
- The `tasks` element has been added, with four tasks listed in the `<task>` elements: `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`.
- In each task, an order number (e.g. `1`) has been added to indicate the priority of completing the task, followed by an objective (`objective`) description, a location (e.g. `Forest`), and the reward for completing the task.
- The `<location>` element has been updated to `Forest` for `task 1`, `Dark cave` for `task 2`, `Castle` for `task 3`, and `Tormak's lair` for `task 4`.
- The `<capture>` element has been added to represent the task of capturing Tormak's lair.
The original XML data remains unchanged, but with the corrected values in the correct syntax. The output in XML format is as follows:
