```xml
XML fixed:
The XML data has been corrected with the following changes:

  1. The missing `quest-giver` element has been added to the `<tasks>` tag.
  2. The task order in the `<tasks>` list has been updated to reflect the correct order of tasks: `3 -> 4 -> 5`.

Here's the XML data with the corrected syntax and new values:
