The XML data has been fixed with the following changes:
1. Corrected the `quest-giver` attribute name to `QuestGiver`.
2. Added a new task "Report back to the Tavern owner" with an objective of "Once you have killed all the rats, return to the tavern owner and tell him the good news."
3. Updated the reward object to include a value for each task using a `<value>` element.
4. Moved the `report-back-to-the-tavern-owner` task after the first successful kill in the correct location (Tavern).
