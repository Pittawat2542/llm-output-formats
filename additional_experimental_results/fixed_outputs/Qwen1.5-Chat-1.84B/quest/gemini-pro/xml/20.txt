The XML data has been fixed with the following changes:
1. The value for key_completeness in the `<game>` element has been corrected to "Exterminate the rats in the cellar of the abandoned house."
2. A new `<trial>` element has been added under `<task>` to represent each task in the quest.
3. The locations of the tasks have been updated to match their respective descriptions.
4. The reward for completing all three trials is now "100 gold pieces."
