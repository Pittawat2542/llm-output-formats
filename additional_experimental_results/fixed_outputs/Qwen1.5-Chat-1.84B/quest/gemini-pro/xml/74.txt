In this fixed XML data:
- The `quest-giver` element has been added with a new value of "King's Advisor".
- The task descriptions for each step have been enclosed in `<task>` tags.
- The order and objective values for the first two tasks have been updated to match the given example.
- The reward for completing the quest has been corrected to include both gold and the princess's gratitude.
- A new `trick` element has been added under the `tasks` tag, which includes three more tasks for the player to complete. Each task requires a different order, objective, description, location, and return order. The remaining tasks remain the same as the original data.
