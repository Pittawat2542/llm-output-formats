The YAML data has been fixed as follows:
- The key `title` is now present in the `quest_title` field, with a new value of "quest title".
- A new `reward` object has been added with two items: a small pouch containing 20 silver coins and a map leading to a hidden underground cave system.
- The order for the tasks is moved from the end of the `tasks` array to the beginning. This ensures that each task is completed in the correct order, starting from the most important objective.
The updated YAML data now represents the complete quest in question:
