The XML data has been fixed and provided as requested. The updated XML includes a new `<quest-giver>` element with the value `Professor Birch` for the quest giver, and the `<tasks>` element now lists three tasks instead of two. Each task has an `<order>` element specifying its order within the list and a description. The task locations have been included in the `<location>` element for each task. Additionally, the `<reward>` element has been updated to include `500 gold coins` and `'Ancient Explorer' title'. Finally, there is a newline character (`\n`) inserted between each task to separate them in the XML output.
