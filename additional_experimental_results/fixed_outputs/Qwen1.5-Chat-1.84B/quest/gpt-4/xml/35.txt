In the fixed XML data, I have added missing elements as requested: 

- `quest-giver` has been added to `<quest-giver>` with the value 'King Arthur'.
- The `<tasks>` element has been added inside the `<game>` element with the appropriate tasks.
- The `<order>` and `<objective>` elements have been moved outside of the `<task>` elements for clarity. 

Here's the XML data with the corrected syntax:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<game>
	<id>1234</id>
	<title>Defeat the Dragon</title>
	<objective>Defeat the giant dragon terrorizing the city.</objective>

	<reward>5000 XP + Legendary Sword</reward>
	<quest-giver>King Arthur</quest-giver>
	<tasks>
			<task order="1">
