Explanation:
1. The `<game>` element has been moved to the root of the XML document, with an ID attribute.
2. The `<id>` element contains a new value "123456" for the game's unique identifier.
3. The `<title>` element now specifies the title of the game, which is "The Lost Artifact".
4. The `<objective>` element has been added to specify the primary objective of the game, which is to find and return a lost artifact to a village elder.
5. The `<description>` element provides more details about the quest, including its setting (a battle between orcs and humans) and objectives (solving puzzles in a hidden temple).
6. A new `<reward>` element has been added with a value of 5000 gold and an ` Elder's blessing` attribute to indicate the reward for completing the quest.
7. The `<quest-giver>` element specifies the character who will be completing the quest, which is "Village Elder".
8. An additional `<task>` element is added with three triggers: a `trigger` element for crossing the orc territory (order 1), a `trigger` element for solving the temple puzzle (order 2), and another `trigger` element for returning the artifact (order 3). Each trigger has its own objective, description, location, and reward.
9. The `<tasks>` element now contains a list of all the tasks that need to be completed in order to complete the quest.

The resulting XML data is:
