The XML data has been fixed as per the provided requirements. The syntax is corrected, and new values have been added for the quest-giver 'King Arthur' with the reward '5000 gold coins and the Knight title', and the locations of the trials ('North Mountains' for the first trial, 'Dragon's Den' for the second trial, and 'Magical Forest' for the fourth trial). The XML data now represents a completed game with the specified objectives, rewards, and challenges.
