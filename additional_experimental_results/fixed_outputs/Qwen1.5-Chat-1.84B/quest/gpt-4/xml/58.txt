The corrected XML data includes the following changes:
- The value of `quest_giver` has been updated to `<quest-giver>Professor Archibald</quest-giver>`.
- The `tasks` element has been removed as it no longer pertains to the quest's tasks.
- The `task` elements have been moved inside the `tasks` list and their order has been adjusted to reflect their respective objectives, locations, and descriptions. The `<location>` tag now contains the actual location of the task.
- The XML code block is now formatted according to Markdown syntax with an opening `<?xml version="1.0"?>` declaration at the top, a closing `</game>` tag, and the original message between the opening and closing tags within the Markdown code block.
