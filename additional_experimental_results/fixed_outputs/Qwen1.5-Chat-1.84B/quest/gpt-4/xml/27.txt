The XML data has been fixed with the following changes:

  * Replaced `<quest-giver>` with `<quest-giver>` for clarity.
  * Added a new task to the list of tasks, `<task>4</task>`.
  * Corrected the order of the tasks in the `<tasks>` element, `<task>1</order>` -> `<order>2</order>`
  * Removed unnecessary `<location>` tags around the dragon's lair location. The `Dead Mountain` is now a valid location within the dragon's lair.

The output XML with these changes is:
