```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: 1
    speaker: "Speaker 1"
    text: "Dialogue 1"
  - order: 2
    speaker: "Speaker 2"
    text: "Dialogue 2"
  - order: 3
    speaker: "Speaker 3"
    text: "Dialogue 3"
  - order: 4
    speaker: "Speaker 4"
    text: "Dialogue 4"
  - order: 5
    speaker: "Speaker 5"
    text: "Dialogue 5"
```

### Explanation:
I have corrected the YAML syntax by adding quotation marks around the speaker names and dialogue texts. This will ensure that they are treated as strings in the YAML document. Also, I have updated the speaker names and dialogue texts to provide examples. You can replace them with actual values as needed.
