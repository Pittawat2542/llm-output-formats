### Explanation:

The YAML data provided in the original message had an indentation issue, causing a syntax error. To fix it, I simply added two spaces before each line under the 'dialogues' key to ensure proper indentation. Additionally, no changes were made to the text of the dialogues, so they remained the same as the original.
