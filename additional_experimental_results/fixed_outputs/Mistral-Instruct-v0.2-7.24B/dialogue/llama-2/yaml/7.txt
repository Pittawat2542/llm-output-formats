```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text: dialogue or narration
```
### Explanation:

The YAML data provided in the original message was correctly formatted and did not contain any syntax errors. However, since no error message was given in the problem statement, it's possible that there was an issue with the editor or environment used to view the YAML data, causing the incorrect syntax error message to be displayed.

Therefore, the only output for this task is the original correct YAML data provided below:
```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text: dialogue or narration
```
