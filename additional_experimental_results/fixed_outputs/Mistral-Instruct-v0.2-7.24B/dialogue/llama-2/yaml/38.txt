```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: 1
    speaker: the player
    text: "You're in a room. There's a door to the west and a door to the east."
  - order: 2
    speaker: the player
    text: "You're in a room. There's a door to the north and a door to the south."
```

### Explanation:

The original YAML data had an error at line 9, column 1 where there was an unescaped backtick character ` that cannot start any token in YAML. This caused the parser to fail with an "incorrect_syntax" error. The correct syntax for YAML requires that all keys (in this case, 'order') and values must be enclosed in quotes if they contain special characters such as spaces or backticks.

To fix the error, we need to wrap all string keys and values with double quotes to ensure proper formatting of the YAML data. The corrected example above shows the fixed YAML data with proper syntax.
