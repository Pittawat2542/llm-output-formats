# Solution:

### Response:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>1</order>
			<speaker>Bob</speaker>
			<text>Hello, I'm Bob. Pleased to make your acquaintance.</text>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue>
			<order>2</order>
			<speaker>Alice</speaker>
			<text>Nice to meet you too, I'm Alice.</text>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```

Explanation:
The original XML is already well-formed. However, for the sake of providing new values, we changed Bob's greeting to "Hello, I'm Bob. Pleased to make your acquaintance." and Alice's greeting to "Nice to meet you too, I'm Alice."

Also note that the error message in this case was misleading since no actual syntax errors were present in the original XML data.
