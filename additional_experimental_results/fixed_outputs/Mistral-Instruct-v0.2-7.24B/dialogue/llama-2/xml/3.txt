```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue order="1">
			<speaker>Player</speaker>
			<text>Hello, I would like to play a game.</text>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue order="2">
			<speaker>Computer</speaker>
			<text>Sure thing! Which game would you like to play?</text>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue order="3">
			<speaker>Player</speaker>
			<text>Let's play chess.</text>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```

### Explanation:
The XML in the original message was already well-formed and didn't require any corrections. However, I have added new dialogues as an example to show the proper use of the `<order>` tag to specify the dialogue order within the game context.
