The provided text was not XML format. It's just a text message. To make it an XML, we need to wrap the whole thing in a root element and add some metadata like version and encoding. I have assumed the root element to be `<game>` with dialogues as its child. Also, I added order for dialogue, speaker name and text for each dialogues.

### Explanation:
The given text was not in XML format and it does not follow any particular XML schema. To convert it into an XML format, we need to add some metadata at the top like version and encoding, wrap the whole thing inside a root element and create child elements for each dialogue with order, speaker name and text as its child elements.
