The issue was that the XML document didn't have a namespace declared, which caused an error when trying to parse it because the "xsi:type" attribute wasn't defined. By adding the "xmlns:xsi" attribute at the root level and specifying its value as "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", we can use the "xsi:type" attribute to indicate that the data type of an element's child is a specific XML schema type, such as "xs:int" in this case.
