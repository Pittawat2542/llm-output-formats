```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text: >
      ![text of dialogue or narration](path/to/image.png)
      text of dialogue or narration
```

Explanation: The error message indicates that there is a syntax issue with the `text` key. Specifically, it says that a ':' character was expected but not found. This suggests that the YAML parser is interpreting the first line of the value under `text` as a new key-value pair, rather than treating the entire string as a single value.

To fix this issue, we can wrap the entire string (including the image reference) in a block scalar using the '>' character. This will tell the YAML parser to treat the entire block as a single value, without interpreting the '!' character as the start of a new key-value pair.

Additionally, since the error message indicates that there is an open bracket at the beginning of `speaker`, it's likely that this was meant to be a string rather than an array. So we change it back to a simple string by removing the brackets.
