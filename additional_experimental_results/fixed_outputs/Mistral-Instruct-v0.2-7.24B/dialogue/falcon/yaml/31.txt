The `order` key is missing in the `dialogue`, so it needs to be added, and the gender pronouns should be updated accordingly. The backticks before Player 1 are not needed; therefore, they have been removed. Here's the corrected YAML data.

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - speaker: Player 1
    order: dialogue order
    text: He likes playing games.

```

Updated output in YAML format with corrected key and updated gender pronouns if required:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - speaker: <Player 1>
    order: dialogue order
    text: She likes playing games.

```

or

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - speaker: Player 1
    order: dialogue order
    text: He likes playing games.

```
