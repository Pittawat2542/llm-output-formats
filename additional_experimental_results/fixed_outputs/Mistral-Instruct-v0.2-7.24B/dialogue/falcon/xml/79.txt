The original XML data is incorrect and does not conform to the template provided. The template is for XML data representing dialogues in a game. Instead, we have an XML declaration and markdown enhanced document type declaration which are unrelated to this task.

To fix the issue, we need to remove the incorrect declarations from the XML data. Here's the corrected version of the template:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>dialogue order</order>
			<speaker>speaker name</speaker>
			<text>dialogue or narration</text>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```

And the corrected version of the original XML data:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<!-- Add dialogues here -->
	</dialogues>
</game>
```

This corrected version does not contain any incorrect syntax and is a valid representation of XML data for game dialogues according to the template provided.
