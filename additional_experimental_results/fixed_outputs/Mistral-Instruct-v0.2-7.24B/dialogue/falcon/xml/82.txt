The XML provided in the original message contains incorrect syntax and inconsistent naming. To fix the issue, follow these steps:

1. Remove the unnecessary `<style>` tag at the beginning of the file since it is not related to the XML structure.
2. Change the root element name from `<Game>` to `<game>` for consistency with the rest of the document.
3. Correct the capitalization of the child elements `<Dialogues>` and `<Dialogue>` to `<dialogues>` and `<dialogue>`, respectively, for proper XML naming conventions.
4. Update the `<ordered>` tag name to `<order>` to match the correct tag name in the template.

Here's the corrected XML data:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order order of dialogs>
				<Speaker name="Speaker name">
					<Text text="Dialogue or narration"/>
				</Speaker>
			</order>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue>
			<order order of dialogs>
				<Speaker name="Speaker name">
					<Text text="Dialogue or narration"/>
				</Speaker>
			</order>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```
