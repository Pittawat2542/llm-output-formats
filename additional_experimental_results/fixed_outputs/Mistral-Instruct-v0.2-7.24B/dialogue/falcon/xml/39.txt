```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue order="dialogue order">
			<speaker>speaker name</speaker>
			<text><![CDATA[dialogue text]]></text>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```

Explanation:
The issue is that the `gms:order` tag is not closed properly and is instead being used as a child of the `gms:dialog` tag. To fix this, the `gms:order` tag should be removed from within the `gms:dialog` tag and instead be a sibling to it, with its own `<dialogue>` tag containing its attributes and text content. The order attribute should also be changed to "dialogue order" as stated in the template for consistency.
