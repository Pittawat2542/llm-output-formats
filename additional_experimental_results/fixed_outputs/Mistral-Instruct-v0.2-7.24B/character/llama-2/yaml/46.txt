This is a simple example for testing the Character class in VBNet. The tests include checking if the Character has a first name, an id, and it's overall validity. You can add more test cases as needed to ensure thorough coverage of all possible scenarios. Remember that the order and placement of the tests might matter depending on the implementation of your testing framework.
