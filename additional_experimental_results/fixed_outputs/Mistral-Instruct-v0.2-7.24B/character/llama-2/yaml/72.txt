```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 25
    background: grew up in a small town
    first_name: John
    id: 1
    last_name: Smith
    physical_appearance:
      eye_color: blue
      hair_color: brown
      height: 1.8
      weight: 80
    place_of_birth: Earth
    role: pilot
    species: human
```
### Explanation:
The error was caused by the incorrect usage of lists and dictionaries within a dictionary. To fix this issue, we need to change the format of the `physical_appearance` key from a list to a dictionary. We'll assign keys with their respective values as shown below:
```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 25
    background: grew up in a small town
    first_name: John
    id: 1
    last_name: Smith
    physical_appearance:
      eye_color: blue
      hair_color: brown
      height: 1.8
      weight: 80
    place_of_birth: Earth
    role: pilot
    species: human
```
This change makes the YAML valid and removes the error.
