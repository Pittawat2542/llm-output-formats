HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Server: Apache/2.4.7 (Win64) PHP/5.6.31

```

### Discussion

This issue was caused by the incorrect formatting of the `Content-Type` header in the client's request. The server correctly returned an error message stating that there was no content provided in the request body. In this case, it looks like the client may not have intended to send any data with their request, and they can simply use the empty request body as shown below:
```javascript
POST /api/characters HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
{}
```

The server will then process this empty request with the given endpoint and return whatever data it has prepared for that route, as shown below:
```css
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Server: Apache/2.4.7 (Win64) PHP/5.6.31
Date: Mon, 19 Dec 2016 15:15:47 GMT
Status: 200 OK
