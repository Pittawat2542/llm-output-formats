```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: exact age or description
    background: background story
    first_name: first name
    id: id
    last_name: last name
    physical_appearance:
    - eye_color: eye color
      hair_color: hair color
      height: float value
      weight: float value
    place_of_birth: location
    role: role of the character
    species: species
```

You need to update the `height` and `weight` keys in the physical appearance dictionary to be of type `float`. Currently, they are being defined as strings with the label "float value", but they should just be floats. Here's how you can modify your YAML to fix this issue:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: exact age or description
    background: background story
    first_name: first_name
    id: id
    last_name: last_name
    physical_appearance:
      eye_color: eye_color
      hair_color: hair_color
      height: 1.75  # or any other valid float value
      weight: 80.5  # or any other valid float value
    place_of_birth: location
    role: role_of_the_character
    species: species
```

This should resolve the error you encountered when trying to load your YAML file into Python using PyYAML. If you still encounter issues, make sure that the `height` and `weight` values in the `physical_appearance` dictionary are valid floats.
