    background: "Grew up in a small town with her parents and two siblings."
    first_name: "Teresa"

### Explanation:

The error message suggests that there is an incorrect use of backticks (`) in the YAML data. However, upon inspection of the provided `Original` code block, it appears that there are no instances of backticks being used improperly.

Therefore, assuming that the original YAML data was valid, the only change needed to fix the syntax error is to convert the height and weight strings with imperial units to float values in the `physical_appearance` list.

The corrected YAML data is provided above as the response.
