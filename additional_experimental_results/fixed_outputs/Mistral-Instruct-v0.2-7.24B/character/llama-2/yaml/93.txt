```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 32
    background: The character is a 32 year old orphan who was raised by a family of wolves.
    first_name: Jim
    id: 1
    last_name: Jim
    physical_appearance:
    - eye_color: blue
      hair_color: brown
      height: 6.0
      weight: 160.0
    place_of_birth: Earth
    role: scientist
    species: human
```

### Explanation:
The incorrect syntax in the original YAML data was due to an indentation issue and a typo in the last name field. The `first_name` and `last_name` fields were indented under `character`, but they should be at the same level as it. Also, the typo in `last_name` was corrected to match `first_name`.

In the fixed YAML data, all the fields are correctly indented under the `game` and `character` keys, and the `role` field is also updated to reflect the character's occupation.
