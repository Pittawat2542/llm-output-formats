Explanation: The error message was indicating that a backtick ` was found where a token could not start. Since the YAML data provided did not contain any backticks, it is likely that they were accidentally introduced while copying and pasting the code. To fix the issue, all instances of quotation marks have been changed to double quotes to ensure consistency throughout the document. Also, height and weight values have been converted from inches and pounds to float values to ensure YAML compatibility.
