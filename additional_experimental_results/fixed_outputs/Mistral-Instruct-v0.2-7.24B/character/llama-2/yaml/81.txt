```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 30
    background: a story about the character's past
    first_name: John
    id: 12345
    last_name: Smith
    physical_appearance:
      eye_color: brown
      hair_color: black
      height: 180
      weight: 85
    place_of_birth: New York
    role: a character in a story
    species: human
```

### Explanation:

The provided YAML code contained an indentation issue, where the properties under `physical_appearance` were not indented properly. This caused a syntax error. To fix this, we need to ensure that all properties under `character` are indented consistently with two spaces. In the fixed response above, I have made the necessary corrections by removing the extra level of indentation for `eye_color`, `hair_color`, `height`, and `weight` under `physical_appearance`. This should make the YAML valid again.
