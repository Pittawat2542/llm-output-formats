```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 25
    background:
      - "I was born in a small village in the north of the continent."
      - "I was born in a small village in the south of the continent."
    first_name: "Ash"
    id: "12345"
    last_name: "Knight"
    physical_appearance:
      eye_color: blue
      hair_color: blonde
      height: 1.83
      weight: 77
    place_of_birth: "Crystal City"
    role: "Mage"
    species: "Human"
```

### Explanation:
There was no need for correction, but for the sake of clarity I added the missing key `:` in front of `background` under character's properties. Also, under physical_appearance, instead of using a list with one item that contains keys and values, you can directly assign the values to their corresponding keys without needing an intermediate dictionary. Therefore, I removed the list wrapper and added the keys (eye_color, hair_color, height, weight) as properties under `physical_appearance` and updated the value of background as a list with strings instead of nested YAML files.

This corrected version is shown in the response above.
