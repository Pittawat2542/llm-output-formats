```yaml
game:
  character:

    background: "Born and raised in the city of New York"
    first_name: "Harry"
    id: 1
    last_name: "Styles"
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: brown
        hair_color: black

    place_of_birth: United States

Note that the YAML standard recommends using a colon (:) instead of equals sign (=), but it is acceptable to use either in modern YAML implementations. Also, float values should have decimal points instead of periods. Therefore, I added decimal points for better practice.
