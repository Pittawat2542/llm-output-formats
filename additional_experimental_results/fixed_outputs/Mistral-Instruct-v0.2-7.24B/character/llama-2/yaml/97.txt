```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 18
    background: "I was born in a small town in the middle of nowhere."
    first_name: "Kat"
    id: 123
    last_name: "Carter"
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: brown
        hair_color: black
        height: 165.0
        weight: 50.0
    place_of_birth: "Townsville"

```

Explanation: The error message indicates that there is a problem with the backtick character (`) on line 16, column 1. It appears that this character was not properly escaped, causing the YAML parser to raise an error. To fix the issue, we can ensure that all backticks are properly escaped by preceding them with another backtick. Additionally, I noticed that the height and weight values were missing decimals in their float representation, so those have been updated as well. The corrected YAML should now parse correctly.
