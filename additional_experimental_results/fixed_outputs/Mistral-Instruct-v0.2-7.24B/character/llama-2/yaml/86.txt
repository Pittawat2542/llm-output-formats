```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 16
    background: "Adopted by the King of the North"
    first_name: ""
    id: ""
    last_name: ""
    physical_appearance:
    - eye_color: ""
      hair_color: ""
    place_of_birth: ""
    role: ""
    species: "Human"
```
### Explanation:
The given YAML file contains an incomplete `character` object with missing properties such as `first_name`, `id`, `last_name`, `eye_color`, `hair_color`, and `place_of_birth`. Also, the `background` property is a string instead of a dictionary. To fix this issue, we need to update the `character` object with all required properties as follows:
```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 16
    background:
      description: "Adopted by the King of the North"
    first_name: ""
    id: ""
    last_name: ""
    physical_appearance:
      height: {}
      weight: {}
      eye_color: ""
      hair_color: ""
    place_of_birth: ""
    role: ""
    species: "Human"
```
Here, we have updated the `background` property to be a dictionary with a `description` key. We have also added empty dictionaries for `height` and `weight` properties under `physical_appearance`. Finally, we have initialized all missing properties with empty strings or dictionaries. Now the YAML file is valid and complete.
