```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: "Eighteen"
    background: The character is a high school student.
    first_name: John
    id: 1
    last_name: Smith
    physical_appearance:
    - eye_color: blue
      hair_color: black
      height: 6.0
      weight: 145.0
    place_of_birth: Chicago
    role: student
    species: human
```
In the original YAML, there were no issues found, but to maintain consistency with the provided template and to follow YAML conventions for string values, I added double quotes around the string value "Eighteen" for the age property.
