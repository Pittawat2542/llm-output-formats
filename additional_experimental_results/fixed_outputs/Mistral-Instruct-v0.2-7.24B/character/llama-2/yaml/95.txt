```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 23
    background: "The character is a student"
    first_name: "John"
    id: "456"
    last_name: "Smith"
    physical_appearance:
    - eye_color: blue
      hair_color: brown
      height: 6.1
      weight: 180.0
    place_of_birth: New York
    role: The character is a police officer
    species: human
```

### Explanation:
The original YAML had some string literals that were not properly quoted, causing a syntax error. In particular, the strings "5'5"" and "'blue"" were incorrectly formatted as strings with embedded quotes. To fix this, we simply remove the inner quotes and ensure that the outer quotes match the type of the string (double or single). Additionally, we convert the height and weight to floats for consistency with the other numeric values in the YAML. The corrected YAML is shown above.
