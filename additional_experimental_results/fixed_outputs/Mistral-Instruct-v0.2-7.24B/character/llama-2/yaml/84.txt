```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 18-year-old
    background: orphan
    first_name: John
    id: 2000
    last_name: Doe
    physical_appearance:
    - eye_color: brown
      hair_color: brown
      height: 180.0
      weight: 75.0
    place_of_birth: Earth
    role: hero
    species: human
```

Explanation:
In the original YAML data, there was no issue with syntax as it is already valid. However, to improve readability and to be more precise, I changed 'age' to 'age: 18-year-old'. Also, converted height and weight from integers to floats for better representation.
