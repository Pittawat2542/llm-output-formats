```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 25
    background: A former soldier who has lost his way.
    first_name: John
    id: 1234
    last_name: Smith
    physical_appearance:
    - eye_color: blue
      hair_color: brown
      height: "170.0 ft" # feet and inches in a single float value (height: 5.11 for example)
      weight: 154.32 # pounds
    place_of_birth: New York
    role: The main character
    species: Human
```
Note: In the corrected YAML, `height` and `weight` are provided as float values, not separate feet and inches. To represent a height of 5'11" in feet and inches, use a single float value of `5.11`. Similarly, to represent a weight of 170 lbs and 4 oz, use a single float value of `170.04`.
