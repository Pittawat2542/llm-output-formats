```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 25
    background: Adopted
    first_name: John
    id: "1234567890"
    last_name: Smith
    physical_appearance:
    - eye_color: brown
      hair_color: brown
      height: 180.0
      weight: 180.0
    place_of_birth: Earth
    role: Hero
    species: Human
```

Explanation: In this example, there is no issue with the syntax of the YAML file provided in the original message. However, it's a good practice to ensure that strings are enclosed within quotes and numerical IDs are enclosed within double quotes to avoid potential issues. Therefore, I added quotes around the id value. Also, float values for height and weight were updated accordingly.
