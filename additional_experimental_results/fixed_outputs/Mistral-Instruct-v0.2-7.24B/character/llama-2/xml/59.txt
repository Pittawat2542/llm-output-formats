# Explanation

The error message suggests that there is a problem on the line 22, column 0. However, in the provided XML data, line 22 starts with `<physical-appearance>`, which does not contain any syntax errors.

It's worth noting that in the original XML, the height and weight values under the physical-appearance tag are incorrectly formatted. They should be decimal numbers (float) instead of strings. In the fixed version, I have updated these values to comply with the correct format.
