### Explanation:

The XML data provided was missing the `encoding="UTF-8"` attribute in the XML declaration, which could lead to character encoding issues. The `<physical-appearance>` tag was defined twice, so it was removed and nested within the existing one instead. The content inside each tag was also filled out with valid values for the given example.
