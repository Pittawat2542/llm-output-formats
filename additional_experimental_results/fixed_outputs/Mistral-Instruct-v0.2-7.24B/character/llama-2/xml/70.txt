### Explanation:

The error was caused by the placement of the `<physical-appearance>` tag outside its parent tag, which is the `<physical-appearance>` element inside the `<character>` tag. To fix the issue, we need to move the `<physical-appearance>` tag to be a child of the existing one. We also corrected the age value by changing "thirty five" to "35" for better consistency and to avoid any possible parsing issues. The height value was updated to include units as well, since it is expressed in centimeters.
