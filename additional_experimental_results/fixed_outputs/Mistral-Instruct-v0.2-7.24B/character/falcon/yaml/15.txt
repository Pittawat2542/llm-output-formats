```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: ""
    background: ""
    first_name: ""
    id: ""
    last_name: ""
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: ""
        hair_color: ""
        height: ""
        weight: ""
```
### Explanation:
The issue was caused by incorrect indentation of the `game` key. The `character` key should be indented under the `game` key instead of being at the same level as it. Also, I added empty strings for each property to make sure the YAML is valid and complete.
