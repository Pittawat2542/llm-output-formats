```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: "25 years old"
    background: "Grew up as an orphan in the outskirts of the kingdom."
    first_name: "Alaric"
    id: "CHAR001"
    last_name: "Maelor"
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: "Green"
        hair_color: "Brown"
        height: 1.85
        weight: 75.0
    place_of_birth: "Village of Thistlewood"
    role: "Blacksmith"
    species: "Human"
```
Incorrect original YAML had 'origin' instead of 'place_of_birth'. Also, the 'age', 'height', and 'weight' values were not provided. Fixed these issues by using correct keys and adding the missing values.
