This YAML data represents a table with two columns and multiple rows, where the first column is for character IDs and the second column is for species. However, to represent this in YAML format, we need to make some adjustments. We'll define an array of characters under the `game` key instead of an empty object `{}`, then create an array of objects, each representing a character with the specified ID, name, and species.

To ensure proper indentation in code blocks, use 2 spaces instead of 4 when copying and pasting YAML data to make it easier to read and understand.
