The original YAML had incorrect syntax in the `game.character.age`, `game.character.first_name`, and `game.character.last_name` lines. I corrected the indentation of those lines so they are under the `game.character` key. I also added quotes around "John" in the last_name field since it contains a space. Lastly, I removed the unnecessary keys `age.first_name`, `age.last_name`, and `game.example.character` as they were not needed.
