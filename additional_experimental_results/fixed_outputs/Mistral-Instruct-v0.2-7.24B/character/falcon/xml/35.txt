The issue with the XML data was that the `<background>` tag had a string value assigned to it directly, which is not valid syntax in XML. Instead, you must use a CDATA section if you want to store a large amount of text as a value for an element. The same issue was present in the original `<character>` tag, but it was already corrected by the template. Also, I removed the units from the height and weight values since they are not necessary for float values in XML.
