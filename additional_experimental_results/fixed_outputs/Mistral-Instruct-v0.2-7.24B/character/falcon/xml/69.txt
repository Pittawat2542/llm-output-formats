```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
    <character>
        <!-- Your character information here -->
    </character>
</game>
```

The original XML contained an extra closing tag for the `<character>` element, which caused the syntax error. The corrected version simply removes this unnecessary tag and includes a comment to indicate where the character information should be added.
