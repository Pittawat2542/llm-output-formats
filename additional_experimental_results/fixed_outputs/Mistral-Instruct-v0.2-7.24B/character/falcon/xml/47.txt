### Explanation:
The error message indicates that there is an invalid token on line 18, column 0. This usually means that the XML data contains an incorrect syntax. In this case, the problem was that the expected `<physical-appearance>` tag inside the `<physical-appearance>` element did not have a closing tag. We added a closing tag for it and corrected the types of the values expected inside the `<height>` and `<weight>` tags. The `<eye-color>` and `<hair-color>` tags were also expected to be strings, so we changed their value types accordingly.
