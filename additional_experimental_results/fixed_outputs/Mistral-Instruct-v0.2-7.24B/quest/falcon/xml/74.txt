```
### Explanation:
The XML data had two issues. The first issue was capitalization of the "objective" tag in the tasks section, and the second issue was missing the 'quest-giver' key.

To address the first issue, I changed all occurrences of "objectives" to "objective" (not capitalized) and plural in the "tasks" section to match the rest of the XML data structure.

To address the second issue, I added the missing 'quest-giver' key inside the <game> tag after the <description> element.

Furthermore, for clarity, I also added an "order" attribute to the second task in the tasks section.
