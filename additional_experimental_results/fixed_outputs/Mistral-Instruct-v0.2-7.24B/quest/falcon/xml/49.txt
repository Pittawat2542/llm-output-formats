Explanation:
The input XML data is not well-formed as it does not follow the standard format. It contains a table-like structure which is not applicable in XML. We will convert the table into the expected XML format based on the template provided.

In this case, we have to remove the incorrect tags and values such as `<objectives>`, `order=>`, `<id|title|objective|description|reward|questgiver|objectives|order>>` and add the missing tags like `<id>` and correct tag order. The corrected XML is provided in the response code block.
