```json
{
    "game": {
        "id": "id of my game here",
        "title": "quest title",
        "objective": "quest objective",
        "description": "quest description",
        "reward": "quest reward",
        "quest_giver": "my quest giver",
        "tasks": [{
            "order": 1,
            "objective": "task objective",
            "description": "task description",
            "location": "task location"
        }]
    }
}
```
In the original JSON data, the key 'game' was set as a string instead of an object. We corrected this by changing it to an empty dictionary `{}` and then added the correct keys and values inside it. Also, we added the missing `"order": 1` key for the task in the tasks array.
