Corrected YAML data. The issue was with incorrect escaping of quotes in the `location` property of task 3. I removed unnecessary single quotes around the string and added double quotes to properly escape it, since strings in YAML can either be enclosed in double quotes or be raw (unquoted) if they don't contain special characters like backslashes.
