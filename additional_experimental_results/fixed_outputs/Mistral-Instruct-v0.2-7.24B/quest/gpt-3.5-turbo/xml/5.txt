### Explanation:
The error message suggests that there is a missing key named 'key' under `<quest-giver>`. However, it seems that the intended key is 'quest_giver'. Therefore, I corrected the key name to resolve the error. Also, for completeness, I added a new key named 'completeness' with value 'incomplete' to the third task because it was missing.
