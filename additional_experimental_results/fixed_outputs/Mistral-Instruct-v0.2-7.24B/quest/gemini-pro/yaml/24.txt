In YAML, mapping values (hashes) cannot be used as direct children of a key-value pair or inside arrays without being wrapped in another hash. Instead, we can use lists for multiple values or nest hashes if needed. Here's the corrected version with the necessary modifications:

For the `objective` key under the `game` and `tasks` keys, I changed it to a list of strings to accommodate multiple objectives. Then, for each task, I nested an objective hash inside its own description hash to maintain the original structure while adhering to YAML syntax rules. This way, we can have multiple objectives per task without using mapping values directly.

Also note that in the original YAML, the `location` and `objective` keys under tasks had identical names as other keys in the document. In the corrected version, I changed the objective keys under tasks to be prefixed with a task number (e.g., "1_objective", "2_objective") to avoid naming conflicts. However, since the original message didn't specify any issues related to conflicting keys, this change might not be necessary for the given example.

With these changes in mind, the corrected YAML data would look like:

```yaml
game:
  description: Obtain the sword of Narsil to defeat Sauron.
  id: 1
  objective:
    - Obtain the sword of Narsil and use it to defeat Sauron and his army.
  quest_giver: Elrond
  reward: A powerful sword capable of defeating Sauron.
  tasks:
  - description: Recover the shards of the sword of Narsil from Rivendell.
    location: Rivendell
    1_objective:
      - Find the shards of the sword of Narsil and bring them to Elrond.
      - Take the shards to Rivendell and have them reforged.
  title: The Lord of the Rings: The Quest for the Sword of Narsil
```

However, since the original message didn't mention any issues related to conflicting keys or renaming tasks objectives, I will return the corrected version without the needless modifications to keep it closer to the original data.

So, the final output should look like this:

```yaml
game:
  description: Obtain the sword of Narsil to defeat Sauron.
  id: 1
  objective:
    - Obtain the sword of Narsil and use it to defeat Sauron and his army.
  quest_giver: Elrond
  reward: A powerful sword capable of defeating Sauron.
