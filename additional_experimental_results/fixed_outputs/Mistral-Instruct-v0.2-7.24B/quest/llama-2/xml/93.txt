There you have it! The incorrect syntax has been corrected, and the new values have been provided where necessary. Let me know if there's anything else I can help with.

Here's the corrected XML data:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<id>12345</id>
	<title>The Wizard's Quest</title>
	<objective>Find the Wizard's magic wand</objective>
	<description>You will need to find the Wizard's magic wand to complete your quest</description>
	<reward>A magic wand</reward>
	<quest-giver>The Wizard</quest-giver>
	<tasks>
	</tasks>
</game>
