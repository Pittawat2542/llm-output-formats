### Explanation:
The provided original XML is already well-formed. We just needed to add the `encoding="UTF-8"` attribute in the `<?xml version="1.0"?>` declaration for it to be a valid XML document according to the given template. However, there was no error message related to the encoding in the original message, so this modification is not strictly necessary. It's just good practice for ensuring cross-platform compatibility when dealing with Unicode characters.
