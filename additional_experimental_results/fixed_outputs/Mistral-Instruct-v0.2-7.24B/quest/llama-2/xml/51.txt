### Explanation:
The issue with the provided XML data is that it was missing the `order` tags for each task within the `tasks` array. To fix this, we need to add the `<order>` tag as a child of each `<task>` element and assign a unique value for the order of each task. In our example, we have assigned the values 1 and 2 respectively for the first and second tasks within the array.

Additionally, we have updated the placeholders with sample values to provide a complete and valid XML document.
