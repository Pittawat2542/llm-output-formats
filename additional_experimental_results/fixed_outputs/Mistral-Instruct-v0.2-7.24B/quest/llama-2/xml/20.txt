### Explanation:

The XML data provided was well-formed and did not contain any syntax errors. The error message you've received is likely caused by an issue with the parsing of the XML file, such as a missing XML declaration or a UTF-8 encoding issue. In this example, I have added the XML declaration `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>` to ensure that the parser can correctly interpret the data as XML and that all characters are correctly decoded using the specified encoding.

Additionally, I've provided new values for some of the elements to create a complete example of an XML document in the game template format.
