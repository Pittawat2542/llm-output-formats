### Explanation:

The input provided was in Markdown format, but the desired output is an XML document. The error message indicated that there was a syntax error on line 2, column 1. However, since the original XML data was not provided, it's impossible to determine exactly what the issue is without making some assumptions.

Assuming that the Markdown format was meant as a template for generating the XML document, I've manually transformed it into an XML document based on the provided template. The only changes made were:
- Replacing "# Quest title" with "<title>Quest title</title>"
- Replacing "## Objective" with "<objective>Objective</objective>"
- Replacing "### Task 1, 2, 3" with "<task>" tags and their corresponding attributes.

The resulting XML document is a valid game data structure according to the given template.
