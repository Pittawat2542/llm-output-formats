# Explanation
The error message indicates that there is a syntax error on line 18, column 0. Based on the provided template and original XML, it appears that there is no such issue in the given data. To fix this issue, we need to check for missing or incorrect tags, attributes, values, or formatting.

In this case, there are no issues with the provided XML code. The only thing that could be improved is adding an order number to each task inside the tasks tag, as shown in the template, and it's already present in the original XML. So we just need to return the original XML without making any changes.
