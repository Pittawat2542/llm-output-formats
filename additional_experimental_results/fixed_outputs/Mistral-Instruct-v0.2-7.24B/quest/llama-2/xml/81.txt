### Explanation:

1. The XML declaration at the beginning of the file specifies both version and encoding, in this example UTF-8 is used.
2. The `<order>` tag under the `<task>` tag does not have a value. It should be set to a number representing the order in which the task should be completed.
3. The `<location>` tag under the second `<task>` has no value, it should be filled with the location where the player needs to go to complete the task.
4. There was no error in the original XML data.
