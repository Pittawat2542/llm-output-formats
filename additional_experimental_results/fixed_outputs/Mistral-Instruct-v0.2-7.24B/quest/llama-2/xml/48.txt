# Explanation

The error is caused by an incorrectly formatted `<task>` tag on line 18, specifically the missing value for the 'order' attribute. The XML parser doesn't know what to make of this empty tag and therefore raises an error. To resolve the issue, you should assign a valid order number (an integer) to each `<task>`. This will allow the XML document to be well-formed and valid.
