# Explanation:

The YAML data provided in the input was missing a pair of indentations before the `tasks:` key. Additionally, the tasks list should be written as a mapping with two keys (`title` and an anonymous mapping with the task details).

To fix the issue, we added the required indentations to the `tasks:` key and updated the tasks list to use the expected format.
```yaml
# Corrected YAML:
game:
  description: quest description
  id: id
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
    - description: task description
      location: task location
      objective: task objective
      order: task order
    title: quest title
```
