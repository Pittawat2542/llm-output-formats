```yaml
game:
  description: quest description
  id: id
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
    - description: task description
      location: task location
      objective: task objective
      order: task order
    title: task title
```
### Explanation:
The problem was that the tasks were not defined correctly as a list. The fix is to add `-` before each task to define it as a list item. Additionally, I added a 'title' key for the first task, as the original YAML provided this key for all other keys except tasks. This is just an assumption based on the context of the given YAML, as no information about this was provided in the error message.
