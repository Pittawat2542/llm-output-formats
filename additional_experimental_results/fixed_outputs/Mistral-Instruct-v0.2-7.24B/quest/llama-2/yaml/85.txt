```yaml
game:
  description: "A quest to find the lost treasure"
  id: 1
  objective: "Find the lost treasure"
  quest_giver: "The king"
  reward: "A reward"
  tasks:
  - description: "Search for the lost treasure"
    location: "The location of the lost treasure"
    objective: "Find the lost treasure"
    order: 1
  - description: "Gather clues to find the treasure's hiding place"
    location: ""
    objective: "Collect clues"
    order: 2
  title: "The quest for the lost treasure"
```

### Explanation:

Incorrect syntax in the original YAML data was identified at line 17, column 1. The error message specified that an unrecognized character '`' was found and it cannot start any token. To fix this issue, we need to correct the indentation of tasks under the tasks list. Each task should be indented with two spaces under the 'tasks:' key. Also, the description for both tasks and title keys need values instead of being empty strings. The objective key under the second task also needs a value. These corrections will make the YAML data valid and free of syntax errors.

```yaml
game:
  description: "A quest to find the lost treasure"
  id: 1
  objective: "Find the lost treasure"
  quest_giver: "The king"
  reward: "A reward"

    - description: "Search for the lost treasure"
      location: "The location of the lost treasure"
      objective: "Find the lost treasure"
      order: 1
    - description: "Gather clues to find the treasure's hiding place"
      location: ""
      objective: "Collect clues"
      order: 2
  title: "The quest for the lost treasure"
