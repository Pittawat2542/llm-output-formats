```json
{
    "game": {
        "id": "id",
        "title": "quest title",
        "objective": "quest objective",
        "description": "quest description",
        "reward": "quest reward",
        "quest_giver": "quest giver",
        "tasks": []
    }
}
```
### Explanation:

The provided JSON data is missing the `tasks` key in the `game` object. To fix this, we need to add an empty array as the value for the `tasks` key. Since it's an empty array, we don't need to provide any new values. We just need to update the JSON syntax to include this key with the correct structure.
