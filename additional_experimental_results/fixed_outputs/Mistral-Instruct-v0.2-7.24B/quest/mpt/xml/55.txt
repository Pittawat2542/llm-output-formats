### Explanation:
The error message indicates that the key 'quest_giver' is missing. However, the correct key name according to the template is '<quest-giver>'. The 'quest_giver' appears to be a typo in the error message and should be updated in the template as well as any references to it within the code snippet provided.

The corrected XML includes a nested '<quest-giver>' tag with '<name>' and '<location>' keys. These values should be filled in accordingly.
