### Explanation:
The error message indicates that the key 'quest_giver' is missing in the XML data. However, based on the provided template and the original XML data, it appears that the correct key for the quest giver information is actually '<quest-giver>'. Therefore, to fix the issue, we need to add the appropriate content under this key. In the fixed version, we added a new level with '<name>' and '<location>' keys for the name and location of the quest giver.
