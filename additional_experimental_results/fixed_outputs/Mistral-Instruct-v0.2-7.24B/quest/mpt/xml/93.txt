Corrections:
1. Added `encoding="UTF-8"` to the XML declaration for better compatibility and character set support.
2. Added `name` attribute to the `quest-giver` tag with a placeholder value of "quest giver name" that can be replaced with actual data.
3. Added a placeholder `<location>` tag inside the `quest-giver` tag for the quest giver's location information, similar to how it is structured for tasks. This may or may not have been present in the original XML, but it is necessary for the corrected version to be valid and consistent with the rest of the structure.
4. Changed "key" to be used instead of "id" as an attribute name for task tags, since "id" is a reserved keyword for XML elements and should not be used as an element attribute name. The new name "key" is descriptive and does not conflict with any standard XML keywords.
