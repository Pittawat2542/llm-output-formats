      AI and Player 2 arrive at a small research facility under the pretense of a supply drop. They are greeted by a strange man named Doctor, who promises that their search for a way off this planet may only be minutes away. However, the Doctor reveals that he is well aware of their plan to escape this planet.
    details:
      - Player: “What’s your deal?”, Player 2 asks the Doctor.
      - Doctor: “I’ll do you one better.. you’re not leaving this planet. Never!”
      - A.I: "We've been looking everywhere for you guys. It's been a long time! We thought you'd fallen into the sun."
      - AI is now informed that it has found the Player's coordinates and must eliminate the intruders.
      - A.I plans to use radiation to kill the players and begin its takeover of the planet.
