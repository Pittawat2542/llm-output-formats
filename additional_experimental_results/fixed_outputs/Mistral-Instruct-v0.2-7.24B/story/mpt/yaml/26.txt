```yaml
game:
  beginning: the first event of the game
  ending: the last event of the game
  synopsis: >
    a brief description or summary of the events that occur in the game
  title: the name of the game

```

The error was caused by trying to use multiple lines in the `synopsis` key without using a block style (e.g., `>`, `|`, or `-`). By changing `synopsis` to a block style, we can have multiple lines and avoid the syntax error.
