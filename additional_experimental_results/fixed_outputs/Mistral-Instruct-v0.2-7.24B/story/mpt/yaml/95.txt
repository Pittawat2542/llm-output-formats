```yaml
game:
  title: Tutorial Game
  beginning: the beginning of the game
  ending: "no game: the ending of the game" # Change to string or dictionary format
  synopsis: game story synopsis

```

Explanation: Incorrect usage of mapping values inside a scalar value. Corrected it by changing the `ending` key to a string for the original value or dictionary if a new value is given.
