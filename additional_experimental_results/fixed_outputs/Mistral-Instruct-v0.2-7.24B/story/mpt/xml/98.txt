	<beginning>
	<paragraph>The game begins in modern day San Francisco.</paragraph>
	<paragraph>There are plenty of people living here. It's a city like any other, full of both good and bad inhabitants.</paragraph>

	<ending>
	The game ends here.

Changes made: Added `<paragraph>` tags to wrap the text in the `<beginning>` element, as XML does not allow direct text inside an empty tag.
