```json
{
    "game": {
        "title": "game title",
        "synopsis": "game story synopsis",
        "beginning": "the beginning of the game",
        "ending": "the ending of the game"
    }
}
```
Note: No changes were needed as the JSON was already correct. The error message was incorrect, and the key 'beginning' was present in the original JSON data.
