Explanation:
The original XML data contained incorrect markdown syntax, specifically the hash symbol (#) and brackets (<>). To fix this issue, we will replace these elements with their equivalent CDATA sections. This will allow us to include the text within the tags without breaking the XML syntax. The corrected XML is shown above.
