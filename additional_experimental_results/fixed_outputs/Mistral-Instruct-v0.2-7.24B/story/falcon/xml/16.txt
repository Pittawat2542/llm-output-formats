```

Explanation: The error occurs because the `<synopsis>` tag is missing the XML namespace declaration. Also, the opening and closing tags for `<beginning>` and `<ending>` are not closed properly with CDATA sections to allow special characters such as angle brackets. This is accomplished by wrapping the content within `<![CDATA[...]]>`. The correct namespaces and encoding must also be declared at the beginning of the XML document for it to be valid.
