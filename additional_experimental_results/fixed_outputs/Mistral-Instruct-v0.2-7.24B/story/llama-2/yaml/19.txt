```yaml
game:
  beginning: the beginning of the game
  ending: the ending of the game
  synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: game title
```

## Output explanation

This YAML file is written in a valid format. It describes the properties 'beginning', 'ending', 'synopsis' and 'title' for the object 'game'. The values for each property are given as strings, with the exception of 'beginning' and 'ending' which can be any value, including strings. The title of the game is set to 'game title'.

The error message "incorrect_syntax: while scanning for the next token found character '\`' that cannot start any token" was likely caused by a misplaced backtick in the code editor or IDE. This prevented the YAML parser from correctly interpreting the file and throwing an error.

To fix this issue, simply ensure that all backticks are correctly placed within the document, either as part of inline code blocks or to denote scalar values containing special characters. In this case, there were no issues with backticks in the provided YAML file, so it was left unchanged.
