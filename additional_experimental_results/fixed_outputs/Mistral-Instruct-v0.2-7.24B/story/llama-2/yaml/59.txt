```yaml
game:
  beginning: "the beginning of the game"
  ending: "the ending of the game"
  synopsis: >
    game story synopsis
  title: "game title"
```

### Explanation:

In the first example, no correction was needed as there was nothing incorrect in the provided YAML data. Therefore, we returned the same YAML code block in the Markdown response.

In subsequent examples, we added quotes to strings and changed the synopsis from a plain string to a multi-line block string using the `>` symbol. This allowed us to have line breaks within the string without having to escape them with a backslash (`\`).
