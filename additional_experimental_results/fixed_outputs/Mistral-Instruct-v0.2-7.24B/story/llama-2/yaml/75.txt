```yaml
game: {}
```

### Explanation:

The YAML data provided is already correct. There are no syntax errors or missing values in the given template or original data. The only change that could be made would be to add or modify the values for the `beginning`, `ending`, `synopsis`, and/or `title` keys under the `game` object, but since those values are optional and not provided in the example, leaving them empty as shown is valid.
