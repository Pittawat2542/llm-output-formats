Original:
[```xml

<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>

Explanation:
The original XML code is missing the `encoding="UTF-8"` attribute in the XML declaration, and the title, synopsis, beginning, and ending elements are empty. I provided a fixed version by filling in appropriate values for each element.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<game>
	<title>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</title>
	<synopsis>Explore the vast open world of Hyrule in this action-adventure game as Link, a hero on a quest to save Princess Zelda and defeat Calamity Ganon.</synopsis>
	<beginning>Wake up in a shrine after a century-long slumber. Collect weapons, explore the land, and meet new characters to help you on your journey.</beginning>
	<ending>Defeat Calamity Ganon and save Hyrule from destruction.</ending>
</game>

### Response:
The provided XML data is incorrect due to missing attributes and empty elements. I have updated the XML with correct values for each element, including the `encoding="UTF-8"` attribute in the XML declaration, and filled in appropriate values for title, synopsis, beginning, and ending elements.
