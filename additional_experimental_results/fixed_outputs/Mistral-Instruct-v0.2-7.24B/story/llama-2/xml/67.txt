### Explanation:
The input XML data was not provided, only a message stating there is an error. However, based on the error message, it appears to be a syntax error occurring at line 7 and column 0. This suggests that there may be an issue with one of the opening or closing tags not being properly formed. To correct this, I assume the XML data follows the provided template and provide corrected values for the title, synopsis, beginning, and ending elements as examples.
