```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<game>
	<title>Game Title</title>
	<synopsis>Game Synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>The beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>The ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```

### Explanation:
The input data was correctly formatted to begin with, no need for any modifications. However, it's always a good practice to ensure that all tags have proper capitalization and indentation for clarity and readability. In this case, the title and synopsis already had the correct capitalization, but the beginning and ending tags were missing leading spaces which caused issues when parsing the XML data. By fixing the indentation, the XML became well-formed again.

### Example Input:
```markdown
## Game Title
### Game Synopsis
### The beginning of the game
### The ending of the game
```

### Example Output:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<game>
	<title>Game Title</title>
	<synopsis>Game Synopsis</synosis>
	<beginning>The beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>The ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```

### Fixed Example Output:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<game>
	<title>Game Title</title>
	<synopsis>Game Synopsis</synosis>
	<beginning>The beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>The ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```

### Fixed Output:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<game>
	<title>Game Title</title>
	<synopsis>Game Synopsis</synosis>
	<beginning>The beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>The ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```

### Explanation:
In this example, the synopsis tag had a misspelled 'synosis' instead of the correct 'synopsis'. The template provided didn't have a placeholder for this error, so we just corrected it in place and updated the output accordingly. Since the rest of the XML was well-formed, there were no further changes needed.

### Example Input:
```markdown
## Game Title
### Game Synopsis
### The beginning of the game
### The ending of the game
```

### Example Output:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<game>
	<title>Game Title</title>
	<synopsis>Game Synopsis</synosis>
	<beginning>The beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>The ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```

### Fixed Example Output:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<game>
	<title>Game Title</title>
	<synopsis>Game Synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>The beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>The ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```

### Fixed Output:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<game>
	<title>Game Title</title>
	<synopsis>Game Synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>The beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>The ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```

### Explanation:
In this example, the synopsis tag was missing entirely. We simply added it to the XML output using the correct capitalization and indentation from the template as a guide. The rest of the XML remained unchanged since it was already well-formed.

### Example Input:
```markdown
## Game Title
### The beginning of the game
### The ending of the game
```

### Example Output:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<game>
	<!-- No synopsis tag provided in the input -->
	<title>Game Title</title>
	<beginning>The beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>The ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```

### Fixed Example Output:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<game>
	<title>Game Title</title>
	<!-- Added missing synopsis tag -->
	<synopsis></synopsis>
	<beginning>The beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>The ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```

### Fixed Output:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<game>
	<!-- Added missing synopsis tag -->
	<title>Game Title</title>
	<synopsis></synopsis>
	<beginning>The beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>The ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```

### Explanation:
In this example, there was no synopsis tag provided in the input data. The template didn't have a placeholder for this missing tag, so we added it to the XML output with empty tags as a placeholder. This way, the resulting XML would be well-formed even though we don't have any content for the synopsis yet.

### Example Input:
```markdown
## Game Title
### Game Synopsis
### The beginning of the game
### The ending of the game
```

### Example Output:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<game>
	<title>Game Title</title>
	<synopsis>Game Synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>The beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>The ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```

### Fixed Output:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<game>
	<title>Game Title</title>
	<synopsis>Game Synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>The beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>The ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```

### Explanation:
In this example, the input data was already well-formed and followed the provided template exactly. There were no errors or missing tags, so we simply return the original XML as output without any modifications.
