The issue with the original YAML data was the use of double quotes in the synopsis key under the game property. This caused the YAML parser to treat it as a scalar instead of a block mapping, which is what was intended. To fix this, we changed the quotation marks surrounding the synopsis value to a single greater-than symbol (>), indicating a block scalar that allows indented multiline text.
