game:
  beginning: In a post-apocalyptic world, a lone survivor wakes up from cryosleep and must navigate through dangerous landscapes to find other humans and rebuild civilization.
  ending: After a long and treacherous journey, the survivor successfully brings different groups together to form a peaceful and thriving society.
  synopsis: >
    A post-apocalyptic journey of a lone survivor,
    searching for human connection and striving to rebuild civilization in a dangerous world.
  title: Rebirth: Rise of a New World
```

The issue was with the long string of synopsis not being indented properly. I added the `>` at the beginning to denote a block style string, which should fix this problem.
