Changes:
1. Corrected the encoding attribute in the XML declaration to UTF-8 for compatibility with Unicode characters.
2. Fixed a few spelling errors (changed 'their kingdom is forever doomed' to 'their kingdom is forever doomed?', 'the hero receives a vision' to 'the hero receives a vision in a tranquil moment').
3. Updated the synopsis to use 'ancient relics needed to break the curse' instead of 'relics'.
