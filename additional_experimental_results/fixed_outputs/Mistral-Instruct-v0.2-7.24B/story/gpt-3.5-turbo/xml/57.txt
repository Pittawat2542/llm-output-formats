### Explanation:

The issue with the original XML was that it did not have an encoding declaration specified in the opening `<?xml version="1.0" ?>` tag. This can cause problems when parsing the XML, especially if the file is saved with a different character encoding than UTF-8. I added the `encoding="UTF-8"` attribute to the opening tag to fix this issue.

Also, in the `<beginning>` tag, I corrected the indentation and formatting of the text to ensure that it was properly nested within the tag. This is important for maintaining the correct structure of the XML document.

Other than these corrections, there were no syntax errors or incorrect values in the original XML, so I left all other elements unchanged.
