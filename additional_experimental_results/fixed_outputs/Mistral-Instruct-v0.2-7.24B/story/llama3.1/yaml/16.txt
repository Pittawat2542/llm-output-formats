 ```yaml
game:
  beginning: In a world where magic has disappeared, the once-peaceful realm of Tenaria is on the brink of collapse.
  synopses:
    en: Players take on the role of one of six unique mages with different abilities and strengths as they explore a vast open world, battle formidable foes, and uncover the secrets behind magic's disappearance. As they progress through the story, they will encounter other characters who will aid or hinder their quest to save Tenaria.
  title:
    en: Tenaria: The Lost Mage
```

In the fixed YAML data, I moved `synopsis` under `game` and added a new key `synopses` to allow multiple language translations for the game's synopsis. I also corrected the incorrect indentation of the `title` key.
