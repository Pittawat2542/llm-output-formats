```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<enemy id="1">
		<name>Goblin</name>
		<description>Small, green-skinned creature.</description>
		<stats>
			<hp>25</hp>
			<mp>0</mp>
			<atk>5</atk>
			<def>3</def>
			<spd>8</spd>
		</stats>
	</enemy>
</game>
```

To correct the syntax error, you need to make sure that every XML element is properly opened and closed. In this case, it looks like the `<enemy>` tag was not closed at the end of the code block. Additionally, I added an `id` attribute to the `<enemy>` tag with a value of `1`, as well as updated the values within the `<name>` and `<description>` tags to provide more meaningful information.

The corrected XML code block would look like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<enemy id="1">
		<name>Goblin</name>
		<description>Small, green-skinned creature.</description>
		<stats>
			<hp>25</hp>
			<mp>0</mp>
			<atk>5</atk>
			<def>3</def>
			<spd>8</spd>
		</stats>
	</enemy>
</game>
```
