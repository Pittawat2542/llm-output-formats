### Explanation:
The XML data provided had several issues that needed to be addressed. The main issue was the incorrect syntax of the attributes in the `<enemy>` tag. In XML, attributes should be enclosed within quotes and have a key-value pair format. Additionally, the values should not be separated by commas but rather surrounded by the attribute value in quotes.

To fix this, I corrected the syntax of the `<enemy>` tag by enclosing the attribute values in double quotes and removing the commas between them. I also updated the indentation to adhere to XML standards for improved readability.
