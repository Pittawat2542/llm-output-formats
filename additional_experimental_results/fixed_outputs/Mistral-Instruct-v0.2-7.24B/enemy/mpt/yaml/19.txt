      es: La bestia enemiga es ferocísima
    id: 1
    name: Beast
    stats:
      def:
        value:
          en: 7
          es: 7
      atk:
        value:
          en: 5
          es: 5
      spd:
        value:
          en: 1
          es: 1
      hp:

```

### Explanation:
The error message indicates that there is a syntax error on line 22, column 1. The character '`' cannot start any token in YAML. This usually occurs when you try to use raw strings or inline literals incorrectly. In this case, it seems the intention was to have a map with keys `en` and `es` under each stat, so we need to use `value:` instead of just an empty line to create a new mapping level. We also need to change the indentation of those mappings accordingly.

### Alternative solution:
Another way to write this in YAML would be as follows:
```yaml
---
game:
  enemy:
    description:
      en: The enemy is a ferocious beast
      es: La bestia enemiga es ferocísima
    id: 1
    name: Beast
    stats:
      def: { value: [7, 7] }
      atk: { value: [5, 5] }
      spd: { value: [1, 1] }
      hp: { value: [15, 15] }
      mp: 20
---
```
This solution uses a `map` to store the `en` and `es` values instead of nested mappings. Both solutions are valid YAML, but the first one is more common for structuring game data in this way.
