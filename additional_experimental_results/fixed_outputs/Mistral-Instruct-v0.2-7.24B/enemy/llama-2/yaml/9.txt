```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "This is a description"
    id: 123
    name: "Enemy 123"
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 100
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100
```
### Explanation:
There is no syntax error in the provided YAML data. It correctly defines a `game` dictionary with an `enemy` key that maps to another dictionary, which has keys for `description`, `id`, `name`, and `stats`. The `stats` value is also a dictionary with five keys for various enemy stats. All values are valid integers or strings. Therefore, the original YAML data is already correct and no changes were made.

However, as a precaution, I'll still include the same fixed YAML code block below to match the input format.
```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "This is a description"
    id: 123
    name: "Enemy 123"
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 100
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100
```
