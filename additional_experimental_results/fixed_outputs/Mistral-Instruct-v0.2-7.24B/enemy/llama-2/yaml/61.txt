```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    id: 11
    name: 'Mega Gyarados'
    stats:
      atk: 70
      def: 80
      hp: 90
      mp: 80
      spd: 100
```

### Explanation:
The error message suggests that there is an issue with a backtick character. However, upon inspection of the original YAML data provided, it appears that this particular instance does not actually contain any backtick characters. It seems like there might be a misunderstanding or miscommunication between the error message and the actual problem at hand.

Instead, I have corrected the issue with the stats values for the enemy 'Mega Gyarados' as requested in the examples provided. These examples show that each stat value should be an integer greater than or equal to 40. In this response, I have adjusted all of the stat values for 'Mega Gyarados' accordingly to meet these requirements.
