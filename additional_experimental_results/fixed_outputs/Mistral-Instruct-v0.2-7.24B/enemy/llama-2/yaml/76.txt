### Explanation:

There were no errors or incorrect syntax in the provided YAML data. The YAML is correctly formatted and does not contain any issues. The error message provided in the input was likely a result of another part of the codebase or an unrelated issue. Therefore, there is no need to change anything in the given YAML data.

### Additional Information:

YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization standard for all programming languages. It is often used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted. YAML has a simple, consistent structure that makes it easy to read and write by both humans and machines.

Incorrect syntax errors in YAML usually arise when there are missing or misplaced colons, indentation issues, or unescaped special characters. To fix such errors, you need to carefully examine the YAML data and correct the syntax according to the rules of the YAML format. The YAML official documentation provides a comprehensive guide on how to write and read YAML files.
