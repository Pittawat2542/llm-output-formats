```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: int value
      def: int value
      hp: int value
      mp: int value
      spd: int value
```

* **game**: The game object.
* **enemy**: The enemy object.
* **stats**: The stats object (optional).

## Explanation:
The original YAML is correct and does not contain any syntax errors, as indicated in the error message. However, the error message itself is incorrect. It seems to be a result of copying an incorrect error message from somewhere else. In this case, there is no need to provide a fixed YAML as it is already correct according to the provided input.

I hope you find this explanation helpful! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
