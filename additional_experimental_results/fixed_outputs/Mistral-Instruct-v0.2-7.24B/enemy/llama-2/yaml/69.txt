```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "A big, green, spiky, ball."
    id: "some_valid_id"
    name: "Big Green Spiky Ball"
    stats:
      atk: 50
      def: 50
      hp: 50
      mp: 50
      spd: 50
```

Note that the error message doesn't give any indication of an issue with the provided ID, so you should replace it with a valid one. The example YAML code is just to provide you with a working template.
