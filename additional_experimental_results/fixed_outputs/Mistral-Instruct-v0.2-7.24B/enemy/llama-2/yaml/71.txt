There seems to be an issue with the formatting of your YAML code. The error message indicates that there is a problem with a backtick (`) on line 3, column 1. However, without seeing the actual YAML data, it's impossible to determine the exact cause of the issue.

Based on the provided context and the example in the template, I assume that you are trying to define an enemy in a YAML file using the given template. Here is how you can fix the syntax error:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "enemy description"
    id: "enemy id"
    name: "enemy name"
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 50
      hp: 50
      mp: 50
      spd: 50
```

This YAML code is valid and should not cause any syntax errors. If you have a different YAML file with the same structure but different values, please provide it here so I can help you with that as well.
