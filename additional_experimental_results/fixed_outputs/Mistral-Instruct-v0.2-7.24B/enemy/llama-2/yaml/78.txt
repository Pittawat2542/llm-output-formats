```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "description"
    id: "id"
    name: "name"
    stats:
      atk: 10
      def: 10
      hp: 10
      mp: 10
      spd: 10
```

### Explanation:

The error message indicates that there is a syntax error on line 12, column 1. The character `'` was found, but it cannot start any token in YAML. However, upon inspection of the provided YAML data, it appears to be correctly formatted with no syntax errors. Therefore, the error message must be due to some other issue not related to the provided YAML data.

Since there is no error in the provided YAML data, the expected and output are identical. The response simply returns the original YAML data as it is valid and correctly formatted.
