```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "The enemy is a giant robot."
    id: 1
    name: "Robot"
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 50
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100
```

Original error message:
```yaml
Error: incorrect_syntax: while scanning for the next token
found character '`' that cannot start any token
  in "<unicode string>", line 12, column 1:
    ```

  ^
```

Explanation:
The error message suggests that there is an unescaped backtick character (`) at the beginning of line 12, which is causing a syntax error. To fix this issue, you need to ensure that all backtick characters are properly escaped by prefixing them with another backtick character. In your given YAML code snippet, there are no backtick characters at the beginning of line 12 or any other lines, so it's likely that the error message is not related to the provided code and might be caused by some other issue in the actual file.

However, to provide a valid solution based on the given context, you can simply remove the `template` header from your YAML code snippet as it is not required for the provided example:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "The enemy is a giant robot."
    id: 1
    name: "Robot"
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 50
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100
```

This corrected YAML code does not contain any syntax errors and should be valid.
