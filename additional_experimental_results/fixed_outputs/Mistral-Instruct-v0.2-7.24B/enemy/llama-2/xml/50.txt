# Explanation:

The error was at the beginning of the XML document. No version was specified, which caused an invalid token error. We added `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>` to fix this issue. Also, the enemy name and description were changed for demonstration purposes, and its stats were adjusted accordingly.
