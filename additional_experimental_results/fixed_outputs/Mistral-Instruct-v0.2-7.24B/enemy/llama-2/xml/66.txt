```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<enemy id="id">
		<name>name</name>
		<description>description</description>
		<stats>
			<hp>hp int value</hp>
			<mp>mp int value</mp>
			<atk>atk int value</atk>
			<def>def int value</def>
			<spd>spd int value</spd>
		</stats>
	</enemy>
</game>
```
### Explanation:

In the original XML, there was no error. The code snippet provided is already well-formed and valid XML.

However, it's always a good practice to include the XML declaration at the beginning of the file with the encoding specified (UTF-8 in this case), so I added that as well. Also, I added the `encoding` attribute to the `xml` version declaration for completeness.

Additionally, since the `id` attribute was missing from the `<enemy>` tag in the original XML snippet, I added it with a placeholder value (`"id"`) for demonstration purposes.

Here's the corrected XML:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<enemy id="id">
		<name>name</name>
		<description>description</description>
		<stats>
			<hp>hp int value</hp>
			<mp>mp int value</mp>
			<atk>atk int value</atk>
			<def>def int value</def>
			<spd>spd int value</spd>
		</stats>
	</enemy>
</game>
```
