### Explanation:
The original XML data was not provided in the question, but based on the error message and template given, it appears that the issue is a missing root element. The response provided above includes the root `<game>` element as per the template. Additionally, since the question asks for JSON format instead of XML, I have converted the template to JSON format accordingly.
