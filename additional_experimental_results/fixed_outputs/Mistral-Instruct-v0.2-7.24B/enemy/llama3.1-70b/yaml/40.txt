 ```yaml
This script will generate a random enemy with stats within the specified ranges and output it in YAML format. The `yaml.dump()` function is used to convert the Python dictionary into YAML format.

Here is an example of what the output might look like:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: A fearsome foe stands before you.
    id: '8142'
    name: Enemy 8142
    stats:
      atk: 25 # int value should not be inside quotes
      def: 15
      hp: 150 # int values should have no leading or trailing whitespace
      mp: 45
      spd: 10
```
