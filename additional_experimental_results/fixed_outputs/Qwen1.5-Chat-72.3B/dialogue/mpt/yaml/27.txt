The original YAML data is already correct. There are no syntax errors or issues with the values provided. Here's the YAML code block again:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: 1
     speaker: Alice
     text: 'As I was saying, there's been an enormous increase in violent crimes in our town.'
   - order: 2
     speaker: Alice
     text: 'In fact, the last census showed an astonishing 80% increase in registered offenders in the last year. It's pretty much out of control.'
   - order: 3
     speaker: Alice
     text: 'But I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. The unemployment rate has been steadily climbing for the past few years.'
   - order: 4
