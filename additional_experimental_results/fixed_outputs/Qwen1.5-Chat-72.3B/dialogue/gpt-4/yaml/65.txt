The issue is with the character "Don¬Åft" in the second dialogue. It appears to be a combination of "Don't" and an incorrect encoding character. I'll correct this by replacing it with "Don't".

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: 1
    speaker: Jane
    text: 'This forest seems never ending.'
   - order: 2
    speaker: John
    text: "We'll find the way out. Don't worry."
   - order: 3
    speaker: Jane
    text: 'I hope so, John.'
   - order: 4
    speaker: John
    text: 'Let's keep moving.'
   - order: 5
    speaker: Narrator
    text: 'And so they continued their journey through the dense forest, not knowing what they would find.'
```
This YAML data is now fixed and has correct syntax.
