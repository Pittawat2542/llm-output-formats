```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: 1 # Added a value for 'order'
    speaker: Player 1
    text: "She/He likes playing games."
```

The original YAML data had two issues:
1. The `order` field was missing, so I added it with a value of `1` to represent the dialogue order.
2. The single quotes around `He/She` were not present in the original YAML, but since YAML is sensitive to quotes, I enclosed the text in double quotes to maintain consistency with the template.
