```yaml
game:
  player: Goggin
  dialogues:
    - order: 1
      speaker: Goggin
      text: Dialog text
    - order: 2
      name: Order of game players
      text: 
    - order: 3
      name: The player's goal
      text: 
    - order: 4
      name: In game events
      description: events in game
```
In the fixed YAML data, I've corrected the syntax issues and restructured it according to the template provided. The `player` is now a key under `game`, and the dialogue entries are structured correctly with `order`, `speaker`, `name`, and `description` keys.
