```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - 
      order: 1
      speaker: "John"
      text: Welcome to the game. Have a great time!
   - 
      order: 2
      speaker: "Jane"
      text: That sounds nice. Have fun with that!
```
The issue was an extra set of indented `dialogues` which should be replaced by individual dialogue entries. I've corrected the syntax and provided appropriate order values for each dialogue entry.
