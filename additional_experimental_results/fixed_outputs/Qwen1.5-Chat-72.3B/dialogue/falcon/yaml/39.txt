The original YAML data has some issues, including incorrect syntax and extra curly braces. Here's the fixed YAML:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
```
This code block represents the corrected YAML structure as requested.
