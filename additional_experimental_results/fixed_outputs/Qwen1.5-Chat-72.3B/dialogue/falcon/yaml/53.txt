```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: dialogue order
     speaker: speaker name
     text: dialogue text
     yaml:
       order: 1
       player1: 1
       player2: 2
       player3: 3
       extra_data:
         order: 1
         player1: 3
         player2: 6
         player3: 5
```
In the fixed YAML, I've corrected the syntax errors and organized the data better by using a `extra_data` key to separate the second set of player values. This ensures that each key-value pair is correctly formatted with a colon (:) following the key.
