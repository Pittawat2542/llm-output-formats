```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: User
      text: "I heard that we needed to hurry up."
```
The issue was with the extra indentation on the `key` line, which is not necessary in this context. I removed it and aligned the `text` key with the `order` and `speaker` keys to create a valid YAML block.
