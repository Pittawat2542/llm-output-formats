```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: dialogue order
     speaker: speaker name
     text: the text of the conversation
```
I have corrected the YAML syntax by removing the extra '-' and indentation issues. Now it follows a valid YAML structure for a list of key-value pairs under the `dialogues` section.
