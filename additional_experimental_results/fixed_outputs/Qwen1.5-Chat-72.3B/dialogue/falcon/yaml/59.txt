```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: 1
      speaker: player1
      text: "This is a do or die situation."
    - order: 2
      speaker: narrator
      text: "Player 1 has to act fast to avoid an imminent crisis."
```
I fixed the syntax errors and restructured the YAML data according to the template provided. I assigned numerical values for `order` as it's expected in the template, and I assigned the correct `speaker` value for each dialogue entry.
