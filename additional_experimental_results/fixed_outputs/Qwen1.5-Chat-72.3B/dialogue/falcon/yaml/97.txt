```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - 
      order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
```
The issue was that the root of the YAML data was a list, not a dictionary. I fixed this by nesting the list under the `dialogues` key within the `game` dictionary. Additionally, I added curly braces `{}` around the list item to properly structure it as part of the dictionary.
