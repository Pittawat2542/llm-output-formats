```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
  <dialogues>
    <dialogue>
      <order>1</order>
      <speaker>Player</speaker>
      <text>Welcome to the game!</text>
    </dialogue>
    <dialogue>
      <order>2</order>
      <speaker>NPC1</speaker>
      <text>Hello there, how can I help you?</text>
    </dialogue>
  </dialogues>
</game>
```

In this corrected XML data, I have fixed the syntax errors by closing the `<dialogue>` and `<dialogues>` tags properly. I also provided new values for `order`, `speaker`, and `text` to demonstrate a typical structure with multiple dialogues.
