```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>1</order>
			<speaker>NPC1</speaker>
			<text>This is a dialogue or narration.</text>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```

In the fixed XML, I've added values for the attributes and elements that were missing or incomplete:

1. Changed the root element `<Game>` to `<game>` to match the template.
2. Added a value `1` for the `<order>` tag to demonstrate a dialogue order.
3. Created a new `<speaker>` tag with a value of `NPC1` as per the requirement to have a speaker that is not just text.
4. Kept the original `<text>` content but ensured it is nested properly within its respective tags.
