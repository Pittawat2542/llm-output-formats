The provided input is not XML but rather a JSON object that contains XML-like strings within it. To fix the issue, we need to convert the JSON into proper XML format. Here's the corrected XML:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
    <dialogues>
        <dialogue>
            <order>dialogue order</order>
            <speaker>speaker name</speaker>
            <text><![CDATA[<]]*</text>
        </dialogue>
    </dialogues>
</game>
```

In the original JSON, the characters `>` and `<` were encoded as HTML entities (`&gt;` and `&lt;`), which are not needed in XML. Also, the `text` element had an incorrect CDATA section format. The corrected XML above represents the intended structure.
