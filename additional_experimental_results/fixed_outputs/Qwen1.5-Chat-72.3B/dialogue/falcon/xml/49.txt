```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game xmlns="http://xmlns.com" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.xmlns.com/sax/ns1/game.xsd">
  <dialogues>
    <dialogue>
      <order xmlns="http://xmlns.com/sax/ns1/dialogues">dialogue order</order>
      <speaker xmlns="http://xmlns.com/sax/ns1/讲话者">speaker name</speaker>
      <text xmlns="http://xmlns.com/sax/ns1/text">dialogue or narration</text>
    </dialogue>
  </dialogues>
</game>
```

In the fixed XML, I've corrected the mismatched tags by properly closing the `<order>` and `<dialogue>` elements. I have also adjusted the namespace prefixes to be more descriptive (`ns2` has been replaced with `讲话者` for speaker and `text` for text) and used them consistently throughout the XML. The CDATA sections around the `speaker name` are no longer needed as plain text can be used without them in this context.
