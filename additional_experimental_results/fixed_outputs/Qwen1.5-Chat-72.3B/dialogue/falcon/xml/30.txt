```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>1</order>
			<speaker>player1</speaker>
			<text>This is player1's dialogue or narration.</text>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue>
			<order>2</order>
			<speaker>player2</speaker>
			<text>This is player2's dialogue or narration.</text>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```
In the corrected XML data, I have fixed the following issues:

1. Added a space after `<?xml version="1.0" ?>` for better readability.
2. Changed the `order` values to be more specific (e.g., `1` and `2`) instead of just "dialogue order".
3. Changed the `speaker` values to be proper speaker names (e.g., "player1" and "player2") instead of containing dialog text.
4. Ensured that all opening tags have corresponding closing tags with a forward slash (e.g., `<dialogue>` becomes `</dialogue>`).
5. Removed unnecessary spaces before the closing `</dialogues>` tag.
