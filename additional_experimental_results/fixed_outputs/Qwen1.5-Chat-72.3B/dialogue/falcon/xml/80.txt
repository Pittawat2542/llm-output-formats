```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
  <dialogues>
    <dialogue>
      <order>1</order>
      <speaker>Player</speaker>
      <text>This is a dialogue example.</text>
    </dialogue>
  </dialogues>
</game>
```
In the provided original XML, there were a few issues:

1. Missing `<?xml version="1.0" ?>` declaration at the beginning.
2. Inconsistent ending tags: `<dialogue>` vs. `</dialogue>`, and `<dialogues>` vs. `</dialoges>`.
3. Periods (.) at the end of some element values, which are not necessary.

I've fixed these issues and provided new sample values for clarity. The dialogue order is set to 1 as an example, and I've changed "Speaker name." to "Player" and "Dialogue or narration." to "This is a dialogue example." You can replace these with the desired values.
