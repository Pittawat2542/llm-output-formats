The original XML data seems to be a mix of different elements from different namespaces. The provided template is for a simple game XML structure, so I've fixed the syntax by adhering to that template. If you need to incorporate the `gta-menu`, `f3f:Layout`, and `f3f:Dialog` elements with their respective namespaces, please provide the complete expected XML structure or additional information.
