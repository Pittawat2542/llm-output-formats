```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>1</order>
			<speaker>Player</speaker>
			<text>Hello, world!</text>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```
In the original XML data, there was a missing forward slash (`/`) before `dialogues` and `dialogue` closing tags. I have fixed these errors and also provided new values for demonstration purposes: an order number of `1`, speaker name as `Player`, and a simple dialogue text saying "Hello, world!".
