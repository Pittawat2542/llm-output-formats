```xml
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>1</order>
			<speaker>Player</speaker>
			<text>Hello, what can I do for you?</text>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue>
			<order>2</order>
			NPC</speaker>
			<text>I need your help to find a lost artifact.</text>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```
The original XML data is correct, but there were no values provided for the elements. I have added example values for `order`, `speaker`, and `text` in the corrected version above.
