```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>1</order>
			<speaker>Player</speaker>
			<text>Hello, my name is Player.</text>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue>
			<order>2</order>
			<speaker>Enemy</speaker>
			<text>Hello, my name is Enemy.</text>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```
The issue was the missing forward slash in the closing `dialogue` and `dialogues` tags. I have corrected the syntax by adding the missing slashes. The XML data is now well-formed.
