```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>1</order>
			<speaker>Player</speaker>
			<text>Hello, what's your name?</text>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue>
			<order>2</order>
			NPC</speaker>
			<text>My name is John. Nice to meet you.</text>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```

The original XML data had incorrect closing tags for `dialogue` and `dialogues`. I have fixed those errors and also provided new values for the order, speaker, and text inside the `dialogue` elements.
