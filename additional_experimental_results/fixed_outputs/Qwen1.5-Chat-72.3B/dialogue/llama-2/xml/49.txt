```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>1</order>
			<speaker>Player</speaker>
			<text>Hello, what's your name?</text>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue>
			<order>2</order>
			NPC</speaker>
			<text"My name is John. Nice to meet you."</text>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```
In the provided original XML, there was a missing `/` in the closing `dialogue` tag on line 11 and an extra `</dialogues>` tag at the end. I've fixed these issues and also added example values for `order`, `speaker`, and `text`.
