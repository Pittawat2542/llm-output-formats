There seems to be no syntax error in the provided YAML data. The original YAML is already correctly formatted. Here it is again in a code block:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: 1
    speaker: player
    text: "What do you want to do?"
   - order: 2
    speaker: player
    text: "What do you want to do?"
   - order: 3
    speaker: player
    text: "What do you want to do?"
```
