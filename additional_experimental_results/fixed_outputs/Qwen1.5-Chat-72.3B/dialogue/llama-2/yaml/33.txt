```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: 1
     speaker: John
     text: "I am John. I'm a nice guy."
   - order: 2
     speaker: Jane
     text: "Hey John, how are you?"
   - order: 3
     speaker: John
     text: "I'm doing well, Jane. Thanks for asking."
   - order: 4
     speaker: Jane
     text: "That's great to hear. What have you been up to?"
   - order: 5
     speaker: John
     text: "Just working on some projects and enjoying the outdoors. How about you?"
   - order: 6
     speaker: Jane
     text: "I've been busy with work too, but trying to find time for some hobbies as well."
```
In this corrected YAML data, I added new dialogues to provide variety in the conversation between John and Jane. The syntax is correct, and each dialogue has a unique `order`, `speaker`, and `text`.
