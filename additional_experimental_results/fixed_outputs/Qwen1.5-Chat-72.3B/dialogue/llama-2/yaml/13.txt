The provided YAML data seems to be correctly formatted. There are no syntax errors, and the values are properly indented. Here's the YAML code block again:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text: dialogue or narration
```

This YAML is valid and ready to use.
