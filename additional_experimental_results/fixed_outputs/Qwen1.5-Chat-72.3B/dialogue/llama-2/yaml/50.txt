The issue here is that the original YAML data includes Markdown syntax incorrectly. It should be properly formatted as YAML. Here's the fixed version:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: 1
    speaker: narrator
    text: "<speaker name> narrates: <text>"
```

In this example, I've assumed a dialogue order of 1 and used "narrator" as the speaker placeholder. The `<speaker name>` and `<text>` are placeholders that should be replaced with actual values in your application.
