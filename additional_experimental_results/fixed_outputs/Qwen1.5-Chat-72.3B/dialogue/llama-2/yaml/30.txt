```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: 1
    speaker: Player 1
    text: "Hello, how are you?"
   - order: 2
    speaker: Player 2
    text: "I'm fine, how are you?"
```

The provided YAML data is correct and has no syntax errors. The dialogue entries for a game are properly formatted with the `order`, `speaker`, and `text` fields.
