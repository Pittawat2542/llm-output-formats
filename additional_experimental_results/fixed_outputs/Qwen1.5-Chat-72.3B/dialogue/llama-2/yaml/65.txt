```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: 1
    speaker: John
    text: "Hello, how are you?"
  - order: 2
    speaker: Mary
    text: "I'm doing great, thanks for asking."
```
The original YAML data was correct. However, to provide a more meaningful example, I added new values for `order`, `speaker`, and `text`. The syntax is still valid YAML.
