```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text: dialogue or narration
```

The original YAML data is correct. There are no syntax errors, and the values provided are valid. The issue mentioned in the error message seems to be related to an incorrect usage of backticks (```), but there are no such issues present in the provided YAML data block.
