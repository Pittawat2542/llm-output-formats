All provided YAML examples are correctly formatted. There is no need for any corrections. Here they are again in a code block:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: dialogue order
     speaker: speaker name
     text: dialogue or narration
```

You can copy this block for each example as they all have the same valid YAML structure.
