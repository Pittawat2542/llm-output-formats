```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>1</order>
			<speaker>Player</speaker>
			<text>Hey, how are you?</text>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue>
			<order>2</order>
			<speaker>NPC</speaker>
			<text>I'm good, thank you. How about you?</text>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue>
			<order>3</order>
			<speaker>Player</speaker>
			<text>I'm doing great too. Thanks for asking.</text>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```

The issue in the original XML data was the incorrect closing tags for the `<dialogue>` elements. They were missing the forward slash (`/`) before the element name. I have corrected this in the provided fixed XML code block.
