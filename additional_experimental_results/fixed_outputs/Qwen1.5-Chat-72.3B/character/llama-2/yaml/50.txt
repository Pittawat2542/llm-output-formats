The issue was in the `height` and `weight` fields under `physical_appearance`. The original YAML had them as string values with quotation marks and non-float numbers (e.g., "5'9" and "150 lbs"). In YAML, these values should be represented as floats without any units. I've adjusted the values to represent the heights in feet as float decimals and weights in pounds as float numbers.
