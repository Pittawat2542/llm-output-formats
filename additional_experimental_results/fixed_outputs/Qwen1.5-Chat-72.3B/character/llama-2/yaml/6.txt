The issue was with the height and weight values, which were formatted as strings with quotation marks and imperial units. I've converted them to float values in metric units (assuming "5' 6"" means 167.64 cm and "120 lb" means 54.43 kg). YAML doesn't support imperial units directly, so it's best to use a consistent unit like meters and kilograms for float values.
