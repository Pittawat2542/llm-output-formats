All examples provided have the same YAML data, which is correct. Here's the YAML in a code block:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 25
    background: "I was born in a small town in the middle of nowhere"
    first_name: "Mary"
    id: 123
    last_name: "Jones"
    physical_appearance:
     - eye_color: "brown"
       hair_color: "blonde"
       height: 5'8"
       weight: 110
    place_of_birth: "Tokyo"
    role: "villain"
    species: "human"
```

Since there are no issues with the provided YAML, no changes are needed.
