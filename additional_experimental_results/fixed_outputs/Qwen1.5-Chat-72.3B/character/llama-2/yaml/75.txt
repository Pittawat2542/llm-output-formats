```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 10 years old
    background: I was born in the year 2000
    first_name: Aiden
    id: 123456789
    last_name: Smith
    physical_appearance:
      eye_color: brown
      hair_color: brown
      height: 1.80
      weight: 72.5
    place_of_birth: Earth
    role: hero
    species: human
```
Explanation: The original YAML data was mostly correct, but there were two minor issues:

1. The `height` value should be a float, so I removed the quotation marks and converted `"5'11"`" to `1.80`.
2. The `weight` value should also be a float, so I removed the quotation marks and converted `"160"` to `72.5`. This assumes the weight is in kilograms, as it's more common for floats in this context.

Now the YAML data has proper syntax and values.
