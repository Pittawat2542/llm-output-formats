The original YAML data is mostly correct, but the issue lies in the representation of height and weight. YAML does not support using quotes around numerical values with units. We can fix this by removing the quotes around `5'5"` and `110 lbs`:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 18
    background: 'My character is a student at the University of Chicago.'
    first_name: Rose
    id: 1234567890
    last_name: Bloom
    physical_appearance:
     - eye_color: blue
       hair_color: brown
       height: 5'5
       weight: 110 lbs
    place_of_birth: 'New York City, New York'
    role: Student
    species: Human
```

Note that I also removed unnecessary single quotes around the numerical values `18`, `110`, and removed the backticks around `'Rose'` since they are not required in YAML.
