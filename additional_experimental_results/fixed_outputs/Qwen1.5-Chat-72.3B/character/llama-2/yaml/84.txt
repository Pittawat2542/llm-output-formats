The provided YAML data seems to be correct. There are no syntax errors, and the values are properly formatted. Here's the YAML code block:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 18
    background: orphan
    first_name: John
    id: 2000
    last_name: Doe
    physical_appearance:
     - eye_color: brown
      hair_color: brown
      height: 180.0
      weight: 75.0
    place_of_birth: Earth
    role: hero
    species: human
```

I have added decimal points to the `height` and `weight` values to ensure they are float values, as specified in the template. However, if they were meant to be integers, you can remove the decimal points.
