There seems to be no error in the provided YAML data. The original message is already in valid YAML format. Here are the corrected YAML snippets based on the rules:

```yaml
game1:
  character1:

    first_name: Sophia

    last_name: Smith
    physical_appearance:
     - eye_color: brown
      hair_color: blonde
      height: 1.70

Please note that I've added `game1`, `character1`, `game2`, `character2`, etc., to the beginning of each block to follow the rule of having the first line be the game name and the second line be the character name. If this is not necessary, you can use the original YAML snippets provided in the input format section.
