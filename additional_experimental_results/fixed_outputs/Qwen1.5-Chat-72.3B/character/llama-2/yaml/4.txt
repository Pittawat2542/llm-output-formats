All examples provided have correct YAML syntax. Here they are again in a code block:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 15
    background: "I'm a wizard, Harry."
    first_name: Harry
    id: 28
    last_name: Potter
    physical_appearance:
     - eye_color: blue
      hair_color: brown
      height: 1.75
      weight: 75
    place_of_birth: Godric's Hollow
    role: Boy Wizard
    species: human
```

Please note that I've incremented the `id` to 28 since all previous examples had IDs from 1 to
