```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 19
    background: "Grew up in a small town in the Midwest."
    first_name: Lisa
    id: 2
    last_name: Brown
    physical_appearance:
      eye_color: brown
      hair_color: brown
      height: 5.3 # Changed from '5' 3"' to a float value
      weight: 120.0 # Changed from '120' to a float value
    place_of_birth: Boston, MA
    role: Hero
    species: Human
```
The original YAML data contained incorrect syntax for the `height` and `weight` fields due to using string representations instead of float values. I've fixed these issues by converting the height and weight values to appropriate float format.
