I have corrected the YAML syntax errors and formatted the data according to the provided template. The `characters` is now a key under `game`, and each character has its own set of properties with correct indentation. I've also added example values for `physical_appearance` for character1, as well as placeholder text for `place_of_birth`, `role`, and `species`. You can fill in the actual details for `character2` and `character3`.
