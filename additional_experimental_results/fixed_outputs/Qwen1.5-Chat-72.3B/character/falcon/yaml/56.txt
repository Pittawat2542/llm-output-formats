```yaml
game:
  character:
    app_name: character_name
    age: <age or age range>
    background: <rpg or story explanation>
    first_name: <first name>
    id: <id number>
    last_name: <family name>
    physical_appearance:
      eye_color: eye color
      hair_color: hair color
      height: height in float value
      weight: weight in float value
    place_of_birth: location
    role: role of the character
    species: species
```
In this fixed YAML data, I've corrected the syntax issues:

1. Removed the extra `-` before `name: <name of current character>` since it was outside the proper mapping structure.
2. Fixed the closing parenthesis for `id: <id number<` to `id: <id number>`.
3. Nested `physical_appearance` under the character mapping by replacing the dash with a colon, making it a key-value pair within the character's data.

I've also added the missing fields from the template:

1. `place_of_birth: location`
2. `role: role of the character`
3. `species: species`

However, you'll need to replace `<age or age range>`, `<rpg or story explanation>`, `<first name>`, `<id number>`, `<family name>`, `location`, `role of the character`, and `species` with actual values for your specific use case.
