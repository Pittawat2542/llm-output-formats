The original YAML had several issues, including incorrect syntax for mapping values and using Python-like dictionary notation instead of YAML syntax. I've fixed the syntax and converted it into valid YAML while preserving the intended structure and values. Note that I've enclosed the string values in quotes as per YAML conventions.
