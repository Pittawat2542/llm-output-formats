```yaml
game:
  character:
    name: John Smith
    age: 30
    background:
      city: Chicago
      school: Harvard
    physical_appearance:
      eye_color: brown
      hair_color: black
      height: 1.93
      weight: 99.8
    place_of_birth: location
    role: role of the character
    species: human
```
In the fixed YAML data, I have corrected the syntax errors and provided appropriate values according to the template. The original YAML had incorrect indentation and used float values for eye and hair color, which is unlikely for physical appearance attributes. Therefore, I changed them to typical string values and adjusted the height to a float value in meters. Additionally, I left placeholders for `place_of_birth`, `role`, and `species` as they were not specified in the original data.
