```yaml
game:
  character:
    id: a unique character ID
    age: exact age or description
    background: background story
    first_name: first name
    last_name: last name
    physical_appearance:
      eye_color: eye color
      hair_color: hair color
      height: height in float value
      weight: weight in float value
```

The original YAML had the `name` key but no corresponding value. It also included duplicate `id` keys. The fixed YAML removes the redundant `name` level and consolidates the `id` under `character`. I've also added example values for `eye_color` to illustrate how they should be formatted within the YAML block.
