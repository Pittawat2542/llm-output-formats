```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 35
    background: She was orphaned at a young age and had to raise herself. She's tough, but also compassionate, and often goes above and beyond for those she cares about.
    physical_appearance:
      eye_color: brown
      hair_color: blonde
      height: 170.0 # converted to float value in centimeters
      weight: 135
    place_of_birth: California
    role: Spy
    species: Human
```
In the fixed YAML, I've corrected the syntax error by converting the character's height to a float value in centimeters (assuming the original value was in feet and inches). This is consistent with the requested format for the `height` field.
