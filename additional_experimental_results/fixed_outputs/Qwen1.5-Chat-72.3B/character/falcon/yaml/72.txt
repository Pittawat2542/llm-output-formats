```yaml
game:
  character:
    - id: 1
      first_name: 
      last_name: 
      age: 20
      background: grew up in a small town learning about the world and its people, was always a fan of adventures both large and small and dreams of eventually going on one and explore as much of it as she can.
      physical_appearance:
        eye_color: 
        hair_color: 
        height: 1.75
        weight: 
      place_of_birth: 
      role: 
      species: 
```

In the fixed YAML, I've corrected the syntax issues and organized the structure according to the template provided. Note that some values are left empty for you to fill in. The `id` field has been added to identify each character uniquely, and the `physical_appearance` section has been adjusted to use a single mapping instead of separate items. Height is represented as a float value (in meters) as requested in the template.
