```yaml
game:
  character:
    name: "Mark"
    age: 28
    background: I was born in the Midwest US
    id: mark
    first_name: Mark
    last_name: Mark
    
  characters: # Changed 'character' to 'characters' for a list of items
    - id: Anna
    - id: Jake
    - id: Amy
```

In the original YAML data, there were a few issues with syntax and structure:

1. The `first_name` and `last_name` keys had additional "#" characters which are not valid in YAML.
2. The ID entries for "Anna", "Jake", and "Amy" should be part of a list, so I created a new key called `characters` to hold these items.

These issues have been corrected in the fixed YAML data above.
