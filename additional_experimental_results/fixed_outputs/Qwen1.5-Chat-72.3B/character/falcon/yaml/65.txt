```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: precise age or description
    background: background story
    first_name: first name
    id: id
    last_name: last name
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: eye color
        hair_color: hair_color
        height: height in feet or centimetres
        weight: weight in kg
    place_of_birth: location
    role: role of the character
    species: species
```
The original YAML data had several syntax errors. I've corrected them as follows:

1. Removed unnecessary `-` before each property under `game` and `character`.
2. Fixed indentation for all properties to be aligned correctly.
3. Changed `height in float value` to `height in feet or centimetres` to match the original description.
4. Changed `weight in float value` to `weight in kg` to match the original description.

The corrected YAML data is now properly formatted and matches the template provided.
