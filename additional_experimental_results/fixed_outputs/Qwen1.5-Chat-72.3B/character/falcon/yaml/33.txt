```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 30
    background: In the present, he is a respected officer in the US Army
    first_name: John
    last_name: Williams
    id: 12345
    physical_appearance:
      eye_color: blue
      hair_color: brown
      height: 6.2
      weight: 175.0
    species: Dragonborn
```
I fixed the syntax errors and adjusted the values according to the provided template. The height and weight are now in float values as requested, and the "species" entry is properly indented under "character". The extraneous hyphen and parentheses around "species" have been removed.
