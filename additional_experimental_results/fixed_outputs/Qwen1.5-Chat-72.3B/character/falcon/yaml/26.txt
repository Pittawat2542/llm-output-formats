```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 23
    background: Born into a family of warriors, the character learned combat from a young age.
    first_name: John
    id: J.
    last_name: Grayson
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: blue
      - hair_color: brown
      - height: 6.2
      - weight: 180.0
    place_of_birth: Seattle, WA
    role: Unspecified
    species: human
```
In the fixed YAML data, I've corrected the syntax by adding colons (:) after the keys in the `physical_appearance` mapping and converting the height and weight values to float as expected by the template. Also, I added a value for the `role` field since it was present in the template but missing from the original data.
