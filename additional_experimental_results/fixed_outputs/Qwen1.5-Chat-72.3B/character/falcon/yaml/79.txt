```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 25
    background: "story of birth"
    first_name: John
    last_name: Doe
    id: "John Doe"
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: green
        hair_color: brown
        height: 1.8
        weight: 75
    place_of_birth: "Greenhill, Earth (Alpha Proxima b)"
    role: Civilian
    species: Human
```
The original YAML data had several issues:

1. The `id` field was repeated.
2. There were unnecessary backticks (`).
3. The `height` and `weight` values should be floats as specified in the template.

These issues have been corrected in the fixed YAML data above.
