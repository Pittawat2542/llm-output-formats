There was an unnecessary backtick (`) at the beginning and end of the YAML data, causing syntax errors. I have removed them.

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: exact age or description
    background: background story
    first_name: first name
    id: id
    last_name: last name
    physical_appearance:
     - eye_color: eye color
       hair_color: hair color
       height: 1.80
       weight: 75.0
    place_of_birth: location
    role: role of the character
    species: species
```
