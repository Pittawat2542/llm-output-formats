I've fixed the missing `game` key and added the required elements according to the template. Some values are left empty as they were not provided in the original XML, and I assumed them to be optional based on the template. The `<name>` tag has been split into `<first-name>` and `<last-name>`, and the `<sex>` tag is not included since it's not in the template. If `<sex>` is needed, it can be added back with an appropriate value.
