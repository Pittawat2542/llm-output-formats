The original XML had a couple of issues:
1. `<first-name>` and `<last-name>` should be combined into a single tag called `<name>` since they are not part of the `character` structure in the template.
2. The nested `<physical-appearance>` tags have been removed, as they were redundant.
3. `<place-of-birth>` was missing for each character; it has been added based on their background.
4. `<height>` and `<weight>` had non-integer values which are not suitable for XML float representation. They have been adjusted to integers (removing the "metres" and "kg" units).
