The original XML was missing the closing tag for `<id>` and had an extra `<physical-appearance>` opening tag. I fixed these issues, added the required `id` attribute to the `<id>` element, and removed the unnecessary duplication in the `<physical-appearance>` section. Now the XML is syntactically correct according to the provided template.
