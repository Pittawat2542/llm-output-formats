The original XML had several issues:

1. The `<game>` tag was missing at the beginning.
2. The `<?xml id="character-xml">` processing instruction was not closed properly and is redundant since we're already within an XML document.
3. The `<data>`, `<row>`, and additional `<physical-appearance>` elements did not fit the structure of the character information, and they were improperly nested.
4. Several closing tags (like `/physical-appearance`) had a slash in the wrong place.

The fixed XML above represents a valid and corrected version of the original data according to the template provided.
