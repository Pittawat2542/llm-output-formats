```
I have fixed the incorrect syntax issues:

1. Corrected the `eye-color` tag to match the opening tag format.
2. Removed the extraneous `<character-name>` tags as they were redundant.
3. Changed the height and weight values to float values in meters and kilograms, respectively, as specified in the template. If you need the values in a different unit, please let me know.
