      <background>Eira was born to a human father and an elven mother in a small village on the outskirts of a kingdom. She grew up learning stealth and agility from her mother, who was a skilled huntress. Eira's father, a blacksmith, taught her how to fight with daggers and short swords. As she got older, Eira became increasingly restless, feeling confined by the village's small size and limited opportunities. She left home at 18 to seek adventure and fortune in the wider world.</background>
