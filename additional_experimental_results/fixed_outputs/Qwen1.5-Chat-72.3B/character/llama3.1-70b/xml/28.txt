     <background>Eira was born to a human father and an elven mother in a small village on the edge of a kingdom. She grew up learning stealth and agility from her mother, who was a skilled huntress. As she got older, Eira became increasingly fascinated with the art of assassination, leading her to leave her village and seek out training from a mysterious organization known only as "The Shadowhand."</background>
