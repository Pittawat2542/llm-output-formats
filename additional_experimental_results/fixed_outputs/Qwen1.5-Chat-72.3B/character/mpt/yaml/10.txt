The original YAML had a few issues:

1. The `-` before the background story made it a sequence item, which was not needed. Removed the `-`.
2. The `role` field had two separate strings in a list. Combined them into one string with proper punctuation.
3. Adjusted the height and weight to be in float values as specified in the template (converted from imperial units to metric).
4. Changed the species from "Klingon" to "Human" since Sarah Shaw is a human character in Star Trek: Discovery.
