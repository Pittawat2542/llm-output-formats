```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 20
    background: "Grew up next to a magical forest. Spoke to animals and creatures. Always dreamed of going to the other side"
    first_name: Lola
    id: 123
    last_name: Morgan
    physical_appearance:
      eye_color: green
      hair_color: red
      height: 180.0
      weight: 60.0
    place_of_birth: "Los Angeles, California"
    role: protagonist
    species: human
```

The issues were:
1. A line break before the 'hair_color' entry in the `physical_appearance` map. This has been corrected by removing the unnecessary line break.
2. The 'role' field was empty, so I added a sample value "protagonist" to it. You can replace this with the appropriate role for the character.
