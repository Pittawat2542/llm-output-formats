```yaml
game:
  description: "Quest description"
  id: "id"
  objective: "Quest objective"
  quest_giver: "Quest giver"
  reward: "Quest reward"
  tasks:
   - description: "Task description"
     location: "Task location"
     objective: "Task objective"
     order: 1
  title: "Quest title"
```

The only issue with the YAML data was that `order` was a string, but it's expected to be a numeric value. I have changed `"Task order"` to `1`, assuming it refers to the task order as an integer.
