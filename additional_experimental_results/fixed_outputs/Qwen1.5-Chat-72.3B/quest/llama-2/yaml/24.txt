```yaml
game:
  description: The quest description
  id: 123
  objective: The quest objective
  quest_giver: The quest giver
  reward: The quest reward
  tasks:
    - description: The task description
      location: The task location
      objective: The task objective
      order: The task order
    - description: The task description
      location: The task location
      objective: The task objective
      order: The task order
    - description: The task description
      location: The task location
      objective: The task objective
      order: The task order
  title: The quest title
```

The original YAML data had a mix of YAML and bash syntax, as well as incorrect indentation. I have fixed the syntax by removing the ```bash``` line and ensuring proper indentation for the tasks list.
