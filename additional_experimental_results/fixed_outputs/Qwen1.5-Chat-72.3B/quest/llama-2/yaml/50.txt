The original YAML data is correct. There are no syntax errors, and the values provided are valid. Here's the YAML data again in a code block:

```yaml
game:
  description: quest description
  id: id
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
   - description: task description
     location: task location
     objective: task objective
     order: task order
  title: quest title
```
