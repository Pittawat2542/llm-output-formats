The original YAML data seems to have incorrect indentation and is presented in multiple code blocks. I'll combine the blocks and correct the indentation to form a valid YAML structure based on the template provided.

```yaml
game:
  description: quest description
  id: id
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
    - description: task description
      location: task location
      objective: task objective
      order: task order
  title: quest title

quests:
  - description: quest description
    id: id
    objective: quest objective
    quest_giver: quest giver
    reward: quest reward
    tasks:
      - description: task description
        location: task location
        objective: task objective
        order: task order
    title: quest title

tasks:
  - description: task description
    location: task location
    objective: task objective
    order: task order
```
This YAML data includes the `game`, `quests`, and `tasks` sections with corrected indentation and structure.
