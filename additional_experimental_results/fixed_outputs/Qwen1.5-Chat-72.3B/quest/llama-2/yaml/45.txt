```yaml
game:
  description: quest description
  id: id
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
   - description: task description
     location: task location
     objective: task objective
     order: task order
  title: quest title
```
The issue was that there was an extra space before the `[` character in the original YAML. This caused a syntax error because it made the parser interpret the `[` as starting a new block that cannot start with this character. The corrected YAML removes that extra space, and the structure is now valid.
