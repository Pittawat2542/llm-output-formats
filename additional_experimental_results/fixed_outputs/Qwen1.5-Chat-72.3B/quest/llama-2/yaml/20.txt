```yaml
game:
  description: A new quest.
  id: 1
  objective: Get a new quest.
  quest_giver: A new quest giver.
  reward: A new quest reward.
  tasks:
    - description: Get a new quest.
      location: A new quest location.
      objective: Get a new quest.
      order: 1
  title: A new quest.
```

The issue was an unintended backtick (`) at the end of the original YAML data. It has been removed in the fixed version. The provided YAML is now valid and does not require any additional changes.
