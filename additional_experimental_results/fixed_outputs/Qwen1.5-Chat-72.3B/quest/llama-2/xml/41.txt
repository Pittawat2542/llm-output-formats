All provided examples have the same error in the closing `</tasks>` tag. It is not closed properly with a forward slash before it. Here's the corrected XML for all examples:

```xml
<game>
	<id>12345</id>
	<title>The Lost Artifact</title>
	<objective>Find and retrieve the ancient artifact from the ruins.</objective>
	<description>You've heard rumors that the lost artifact is hidden within a forgotten ruin deep in the jungle. Your quest is to find it and bring it back.</description>
