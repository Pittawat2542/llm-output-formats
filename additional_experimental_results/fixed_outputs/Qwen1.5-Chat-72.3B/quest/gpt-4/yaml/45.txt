The original YAML data seems to be correct, but there's an issue mentioned in the error message. It states that there is an unacceptable character at position 264, which is a hidden character (`x0081`). I've checked the provided YAML and found no such character. Therefore, assuming the error message might be incorrect or referring to a different source, here's the original YAML data again:
