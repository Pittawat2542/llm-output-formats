```yaml
quest:
  game:
    description: quest description
  id: id
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  title: quest title
  tasks:
   - description: task description
     location: task location
     objective: task objective
     order: task order
```
I fixed the syntax errors and corrected the structure based on the template provided. The key 'game' was missing, so I moved the 'description' under it. Also, removed unnecessary items, merged duplicate 'tasks' keys, and fixed the indentation for consistency.
