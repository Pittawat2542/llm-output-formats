The issue was with the closing `</task>` tags. They were missing a forward slash (`/`) before them, causing them to be incorrectly interpreted as opening tags instead of closing tags. I've fixed that error in the provided XML code block above. Additionally, there was an extra `</tasks>` tag which has been removed as it wasn't needed since there's only one correct closing `</tasks>` tag at the end.
