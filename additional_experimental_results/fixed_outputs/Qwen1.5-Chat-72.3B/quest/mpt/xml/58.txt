In the fixed XML, I have added values for the `id` element and completed the missing `quest-giver` element. Additionally, I corrected the closing tag for the `<task>` element (missing a forward slash) and closed the `<tasks>` element properly. The content of the elements has been provided as placeholders to demonstrate a complete XML structure.
