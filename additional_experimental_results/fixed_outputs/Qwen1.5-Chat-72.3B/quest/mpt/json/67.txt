The original JSON data is an array containing a single object. To fix the issue with key_completeness, we need to remove the square brackets so that the root of the result is a dictionary instead of an array. Here's the corrected JSON:

```json
{
     "game": {
         "id": "id",
         "title": "quest title",
         "objective": "quest objective",
         "description": "quest description",
         "reward": "quest reward",
         "quest_giver": "quest giver",
         "tasks": [
             {
                 "order": "task order",
                 "objective": "task objective",
                 "description": "task description",
                 "location": "task location"
             }
         ]
     }
}
```
