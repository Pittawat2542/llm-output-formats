```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<id>id</id>
	<title>Quest Title</title>
	<objective>Quest Objective</objective>
	<description Quest Description</description>
	<reward>Reward for Completion</reward>
	<quest-giver>Quest Giver</quest-giver>
	<tasks>
		<task>
			<order>1</order>
			<objective>Task Objective 1</objective>
			<description>Task Description 1</description>
			<location>Task Location 1</location>
		</task>
	</tasks>
</game>
```
In the original XML, there were several issues:

1. The opening `<?xml version="1.0" ?>` declaration was missing.
2. The `<giver>` elements were standalone and not structured within the context of a game or quest. I've included them within the `<quest-giver>` tag in the correct structure.
3. The `<description>` tag had a space before the opening bracket, which is an invalid XML token. It has been corrected.
4. The `<tasks>` and `<task>` elements were incomplete or improperly nested. I've provided a complete example with one task.

Note that you can replace the placeholder values (`id`, `Quest Title`, etc.) with actual data as needed.
