```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
   <id>1234</id>
   <title>My Title</title>
   <objective>Defeat the dragon</objective>
   <description>My descriptions</description>
   <quest-giver>Gave up</quest-giver>
   <tasks>
      <task>
         <order>1</order>
         <objective>Task Objective</objective>
         <description>Task description</description>
         <location>My location/town</location>
      </task>
   </tasks>
</game>
```
The original XML data had several issues:

1. The `<giver>` tag should be replaced with `<quest-giver>` to match the template.
2. A `<tasks>` element was missing, which should wrap around the `<task>` elements.
3. A closing `</task>` tag was missing for the task details.
4. The `<order>`, `<objective>`, `<description>`, and `<location>` tags seemed to be misplaced outside the `<tasks>` and `<task>` structure. I've corrected them within the context of a single `<task>` element as per the template.

Now, the XML data is well-formed according to the provided template.
