The original YAML data has the `title` key placed under the `tasks` list, but it should be at the same level as other keys like `description`, `id`, etc. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  description: quest description
  id: id
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
   - description: task description
     location: task location
     objective: task objective
     order: task order
  title: quest title
```
