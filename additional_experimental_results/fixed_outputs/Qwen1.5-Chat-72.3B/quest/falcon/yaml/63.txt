```yaml
game:
  title: quest title
  id: game_id
  description: quest description
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
    - order: 1
      description: task #1 description
      location: task location (X, Y)
      objective: task #1 objective
    - order: 2
      description: task #2 description
      location: 
      objective:

```
In the fixed YAML data, I've corrected the syntax errors and structured it according to the template provided. Note that not all values have been provided in the original message, so some fields like `location` for task #1, `objective` for task #2, and additional tasks are left empty for you to fill in with actual values.
