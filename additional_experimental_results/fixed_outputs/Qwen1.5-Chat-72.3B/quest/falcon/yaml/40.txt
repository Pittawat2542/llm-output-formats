There is an unnecessary backtick (`) at the beginning of each line. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
title: quest title
description: quest description
objective: quest objective
quest_giver: quest giver
giver_id: giver id
location: location
giver_location: giver location
```

I have also fixed the `giver` key to match the template's `quest_giver` and removed the extra space before the colon in each key-value pair.
