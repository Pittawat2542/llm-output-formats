```yaml
game:
  id: unique_id
  title: quest title
  objective: quest objective
  reward:
    title: quest reward
    money: 0
    experience: 0
  quest_giver: quest giver
  tasks:
    - description: first task description
      order: 1
      location: first task location
      objective: first task objective

    - description: second task description
      order: 2
      location: second task location
      objective: second task objective

    - description: third task description
      order: 3
      location: third task location
      objective: third task objective
```
In the fixed YAML data, I've corrected the following issues:

1. Added the missing keys `id`, `title`, `objective`, `reward`, and `quest_giver` as per the error message.
2. Changed `objectives` to a single `objective` field since it appears to be a singular value.
3. Changed `rewards` to `reward` and nested its contents under the key `reward`.
4. Renamed `first task`, `second task`, and `third task` in the `tasks` section to have a consistent structure with their respective descriptions, objectives, and locations.
5. Added an `order` field for each task to maintain the order of tasks.
