```yaml
game:
  title: This is the title of the quest
  description: Description of the quest
  quest_giver: The quest giver
  objective: A list of the quest's objectives
  tasks:
    - description: Task 1 description
      location: Task 1 location
      objective: Task 1 objective
      order: 1
    - description: Task 2 description
      location: Task 2 location
      objective: Task 2 objective
      order: 2
  reward:
    description: A description of the quest's reward
```
In the fixed YAML data, I have corrected the syntax errors and rearranged the content to match the template. The `game` block now contains the appropriate subfields as specified in the template, and the list of tasks is shown with two example tasks.
