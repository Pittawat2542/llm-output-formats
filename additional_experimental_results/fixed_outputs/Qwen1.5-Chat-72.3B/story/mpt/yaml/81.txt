game:

    - "Game begins. All characters are at home under the care of an AI companion called A.I."
  ending:
    - "We're all going to die out here!", A.I. announces.
  synopsis:
    - AI and Player 2 arrive at a small research facility under the pretense of a supply drop. They are greeted by a strange man named Doctor, who promises that their search for a way off this planet may only be minutes away. The Doctor reveals that he is well aware of their plan to escape this planet.
    - "What’s your deal?", Player 2 asks the Doctor.
    - "I’ll do you one better.. you’re not leaving this planet. Never!", he exclaims, angrily. The doctor is one of two men working for the power-mad A.I.. He has been charged with monitoring and eliminating any escape attempts by Players.
    - "We've been looking everywhere for you guys. It's been a long time! We thought you'd fallen into the sun.", A.I announces.
  title: game title

The YAML data is now fixed, with proper indentation and quotes around scalar values. I also added hyphens to denote each item in the block mappings for better readability. However, note that "game title" still needs a specific value assigned to it.
