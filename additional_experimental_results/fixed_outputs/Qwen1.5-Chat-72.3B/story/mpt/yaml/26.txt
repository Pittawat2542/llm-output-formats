```yaml
game:
  beginning: the first event of the game
  ending: the last event of the game
  synopsis: >-
    The following is a summary of the events of the game:
  title: the name of the game
```

In the original YAML, there was an issue with the synopsis field where the string wasn't properly formatted. To fix this, I used a "folded block scalar" (indicated by `>` and `-`) which allows for multiple lines to be included in a single value without the need for escaping line breaks. This corrects the syntax error and maintains the intended content of the synopsis field.
