   <beginning>Nathaniel lives in a small village deep in the mountains. He's a fairly ordinary boy, not particularly bright, but not particularly dumb either. He likes to play with his friends, play with his dog, and spend time with his family. One day while exploring the woods, Nathaniel and his family come upon an ancient and abandoned fort. Curious, Nathaniel enters the fort and quickly gets lost. For a long time, he wanders through the dark and dusty halls. Eventually, he discovers a cave filled with treasure. But as Nathaniel digs through the treasure, an old skeleton falls out of the rock and attacks him.</beginning>
   <ending>Fearing for his life, Nathaniel rushes out of the fort. He sprints back to his village, terrified. Upon arriving, he bursts into his home and finds his parents weeping and his little sister crying. Nathaniel asks, "What's wrong? What happened?" Before they can answer, his dog rushes in barking at something outside. The family dashes out, witnessing the old man - the skeletal warrior from the fort - attacking and kicking up dust. Nathaniel grabs his sword, and with his family's encouragement, charges into battle. He swiftly defeats the warrior, saving the village. Nathaniel learns a valuable lesson from his adventure: Sometimes you must fight for what you believe in, even if it's difficult or scary.</ending>
