```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>Title of the Game</title>
	<synopsis>Game Synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>Start of the game</beginning>
	<ending>End of the game</ending>
</game>
```

The original XML was missing the opening ```<?xml version="1.0" ?>``` declaration and the closing ```</game>``` tag. It has been corrected in the provided code block.
