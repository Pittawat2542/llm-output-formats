```yaml
game:
  beginning: "the beginning of the game"
  ending: "the ending of the game"
  synopsis: |
    # Game Story Synopsis

    This is the markdown formatted synopsis of the game.
  title: "game title"
```

In the provided YAML data, there were no actual syntax errors. However, to include a Markdown code block for the `synopsis` field, I used the `|` indicator to denote a literal scalar, allowing you to format the content as markdown within the YAML structure. The backticks around string values are optional in YAML, but I added them for consistency.
