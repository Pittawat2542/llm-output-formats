```yaml
game:
  title: "my awesome game"
  synopsis: "Game story synopsis."
  beginning:
    description: "Beginning of the game."
    ending: "Ending of the game."
  ending: "The ending of the game."
```
This YAML data has been fixed by adding the missing keys (`title`, `synopsis`, and `ending`) and providing appropriate values for them. The structure has also been corrected to ensure proper nesting.
