```yaml
game:
  beginning: "After a year of training, Sarah is ready to take back Leningrad. Armed with the latest technology and tactics, she and a group of elite soldiers attempt to capture the crucial city. The fate of the city rests in her hands, but will she rise to the challenge and unite with her comrades to succeed? Time is short and the odds are against her. The city is ready, is she?"
  synopsis: ""
  title: "Leningrad"
  ending: "The ending of the game is yet to be written."
```
I have fixed the syntax by adding the missing keys 'synopsis' and 'ending' with appropriate values. The YAML data is now valid according to the template provided.
