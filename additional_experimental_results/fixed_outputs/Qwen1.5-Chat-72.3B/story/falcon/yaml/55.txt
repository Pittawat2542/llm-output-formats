```yaml
game:
  title: The Quest for Adventure
  beginning: the beginning of the game
  ending: the ending of the game
  synopsis: game story synopsis
```
The original YAML was incomplete and had incorrect syntax due to the use of backticks (`) which are not valid in this context. I have fixed the syntax by providing the complete structure for a template about a game, including the missing fields `beginning`, `ending`, and `synopsis`.
