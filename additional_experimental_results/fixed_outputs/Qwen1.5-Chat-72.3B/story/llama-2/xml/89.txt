The original XML data seems to be missing the opening ```<?xml version="1.0" ?>``` declaration and a newline character at the beginning, which causes the "incorrect_syntax: not well-formed (invalid token)" error. Here's the corrected XML:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>the ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```
