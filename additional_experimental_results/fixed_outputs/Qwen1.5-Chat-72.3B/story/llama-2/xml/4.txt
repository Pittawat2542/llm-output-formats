There doesn't seem to be any obvious syntax error in the provided XML data. All tags are properly opened and closed, and there are no invalid tokens or characters. The only issue might be the leading whitespace before the opening `<game>` tag, but most XML parsers would ignore this as insignificant whitespace. Here's the original XML data with leading whitespace removed for cleanliness:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
    <title>game title</title>
    <synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
    <beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
    <ending>the ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```
