There seems to be an extra space before the opening `<game>` tag, which is causing the XML to be invalid. Removing this space will fix the issue.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>the ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```
