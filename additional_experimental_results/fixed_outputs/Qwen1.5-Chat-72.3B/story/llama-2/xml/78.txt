```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>fixed game title</title>
	<synopsis>fixed game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>the fixed beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>the fixed ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```

The original XML data was missing the `<?xml version="1.0" ?>` declaration at the beginning and had an extra empty line before the opening `<game>` tag, which caused the "not well-formed (invalid token)" error. I've corrected these issues and also provided new values for each element as requested in the template.
