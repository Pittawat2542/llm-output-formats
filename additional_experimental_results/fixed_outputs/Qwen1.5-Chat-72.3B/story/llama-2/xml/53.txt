There seems to be no syntax error in the provided XML data. It is well-formed. Here's the XML code block again for reference:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>the ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```

If you have additional information or a different error, please provide it so I can assist further.
