The provided YAML data seems to be correct. There is no issue with the syntax, and no characters like '`' are found that could cause an error. Here's the original YAML data in a code block:

```yaml
game:
  title: game title
  synopsis: game story synopsis
  beginning: the beginning of the game
  ending: the ending of the game
```

Since there is no issue, this is the output you can use.
