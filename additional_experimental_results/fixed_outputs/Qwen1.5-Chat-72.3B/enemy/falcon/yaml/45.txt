```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    id: # enemy id
    name: # enemy name
    stats:
      atk: 0
      def: 1 %d 0
      hp: 10000
      mp: 1000
      spd: 50
    statset:
      - type: spell set
        list:
          - spell1
          - spell2
          - spell3
        mana:
          default: 10000
```
In the fixed YAML data, I've addressed the syntax errors:

1. Removed unnecessary spaces before some values.
2. Fixed the indentation for `hp` and `mp` so they are aligned with other stats.
3. Ensured all lines in the `statset` block have consistent indentation.
