```yaml
game:
  enemies:
    - name: Enemy1
      description: Description
      id: id1
      stats:
        atk: 10
        def: 20
        hp: 60
        mp: 1
        spd: 1
    - name: Enemy2
      description: Description
      id: id2
      stats:
        atk: 20
        def: 20
        hp: 60
        mp: 2
        spd: 1
    - name: Enemy3
      description: Description
      id: id3
      stats:
        atk: 40
        def: 40
        hp: 80
        mp: 1
        spd: 1
```

In the fixed YAML, I've transformed the table-like structure into a valid YAML format that matches the given template. The enemies are now represented as a list under `game.enemies`, and each enemy has their respective attributes (`name`, `description`, `id`, and `stats`). The `stats` section is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each statistic (atk, def, hp, mp, spd). Note that I've kept the values placeholder as "Description" since specific descriptions were not provided in the original data.
