```yaml
battle:
  game: 1
  each_round:
    enemy: 1
    each_round_time: 15
    game__rules:
      game_rule_2:
        name: "rule_name_2"
      game_rule_3:
        name: "rule_name_3"
      game_rule_4:
        name: "rule_name_4"
  rules:
    game_keywords:
      name: "spawns"
      each_round:
        game__rules:
          rules: []
```
The original YAML data had several issues, including a missing value for `game__rules`, extra `-` before the `rules` dictionary, and inconsistent indentation. I've fixed these issues and provided new values for `game_rule_2`, `game_rule_3`, and `game_rule_4` since they were originally empty.
