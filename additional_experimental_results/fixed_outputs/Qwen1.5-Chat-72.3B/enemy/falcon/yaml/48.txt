```yaml
---
game:
  player:
    name: player
    stats:
      atk: 4
      def: 5
      hp: 25
      mp: 7
      spd: 8
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: 2
      def: 3
      hp: 10
      mp: 6
      spd: 1
```
In the original YAML, there was a typo with `-` character which indicated an item in a list. However, it seems that the data should be organized as a mapping (nested dictionaries). I fixed this by removing the `-` and restructuring the data accordingly. Also, I changed the top-level keys to `game`, `player`, and `enemy` for better readability and organization, as per the template provided.
