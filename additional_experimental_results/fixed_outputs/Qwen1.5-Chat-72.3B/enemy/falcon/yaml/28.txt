The original YAML data seems to be missing the `enemy` key which is present in the template. Here's the fixed version:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: atk int value
      def: def int value
      hp: hp int value
      mp: mp int value
      spd: spd int value
```
