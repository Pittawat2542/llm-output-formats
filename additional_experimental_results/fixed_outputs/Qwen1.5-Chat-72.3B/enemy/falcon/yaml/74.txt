```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: A formidable foe
    id: 1
    name: Goblin
    stats:
      atk: 10
      def: 5
      hp: 20
      mp: 5
      spd: 7
```
In the original YAML, there was a list with no dictionary items. I've fixed it by creating a proper YAML structure based on the provided template. The new YAML defines an enemy entity with example values for its description, ID, name, and stats.
