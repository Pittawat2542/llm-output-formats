```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    - description: Infiltrator enemies with their HP
      id: infiltrator
      name: Infiltrator
      stats:
        atk: 0
        def: 0
        hp:
          Enforcer: 7
          Sentinal: 5
        mp: 0
        spd: 0

```
The original YAML was attempting to use a table-like format, which is not valid YAML. I've corrected the syntax by converting it into a YAML list with nested dictionaries. The "hp" values are now associated with specific enemy types under the "hp" key in the stats section.
