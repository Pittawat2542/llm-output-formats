```yaml
enemy:
  description: description
  id: id
  name: name
  stats:
    atk: 50 # Assuming this should be an int value, original expression was invalid YAML
    def: 0
    hp: 800
    mp: 40
    spd: 0
```
In the fixed YAML data, I've corrected the syntax by adding a `stats` mapping to contain the enemy's statistical values. I also replaced the invalid expression for `atk` with a simple integer value, as YAML does not support mathematical expressions directly within scalar values. If the original `atk` value was meant to be a formula, you would need to handle that calculation in your application logic instead of storing it in the YAML.
