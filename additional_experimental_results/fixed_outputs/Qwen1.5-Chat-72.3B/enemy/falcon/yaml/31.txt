```yaml
# Enemy battle status section

game:
  enemy:
    description: Invasions - the foe has arrived!
    id: "NPC123"
    name: "NPC123"
    stats:
      atk: 10
      def: 100
      hp: 100
      mp: 20
      spd: 1
```
In the original YAML, there was a misplaced indentation before `hp:` under `stats`, and then another `hp:` outside of the `stats` mapping. I've corrected the indentation and removed the duplicate `hp` value to create valid YAML data.
