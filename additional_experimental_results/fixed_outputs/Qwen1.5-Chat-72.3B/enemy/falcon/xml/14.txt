```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<enemy>
		<id>id</id>
		<name>name</name>
		<description>description</description>
		<hp>hp int value</hp>
		<mp>mp int value</mp>
		<atk>atk int value</atk>
		<def>def int value</def>
		<spd>spd int value</spd>
	</enemy>
</game>
```
The original XML data had several issues:

1. The first snippet started with `<enemy>` but lacked the closing `</enemy>` tag.
2. It included an extra `<xml>` element which is not part of the correct structure.
3. The second snippet had attributes on the opening `<enemy>` tag that should have been separate elements.
4. Both snippets were not within a parent element, as required in XML for organizing multiple elements.

The fixed XML above addresses these issues by wrapping the enemies in a `<game>` parent element and ensuring all data is structured correctly with appropriate opening and closing tags.
