```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<enemy>
		<id>X</id>
		<name>X description</name>
		<description></description>
		<stats>
			<hp>X_hp int value</hp>
			<mp>X_mp int value</mp>
			<atk>X_atk int value</atk>
			<def>X_def int value</def>
			<spd>X_speed int value</spd>
		</stats>
	</enemy>
</game>
```

The fixed XML data has corrected the following issues:
1. Removed the extra "The enemy can be created from the following code:" text.
2. Closed the `<enemy>` tag properly with `</enemy>`.
3. Added a `<description>` tag (empty) as it was present in the template but missing in the original XML.
4. Fixed the `<atk>` tag by replacing the space between "X" and "atk" with an underscore (`<atk>X_atk int value</atk>`).
5. Fixed the `<spd>` tag by replacing "speed" with "spd" to match the template (`<spd>X_speed int value</spd>`).
