I've corrected the mismatched tags, removed unnecessary and incorrectly formatted data within the `<stats>` section, and provided new values for the attributes and elements where they were missing or incorrect. The `id` attribute value has been used as the value for the `<id>` element, and appropriate integer values have been assigned to other stats.
