There doesn't seem to be any syntax errors in the provided YAML data. Both examples are correctly formatted. Here they are again for reference:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: The Dark Knight
    id: E001
    name: Black Dragon
    stats:
      atk: 200
      def: 300
      hp: 1000
      mp: 500
      spd: 150

# Or, for a more complex enemy:

game:
  enemy:
    description: The Ancient Lizard King
    id: E002
    name: Lizard King
    stats:
      atk: 250
