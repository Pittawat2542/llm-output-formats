The original YAML data does not contain any syntax errors, and it has valid values. Here's the YAML code block as provided:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: atk int value
      def: def int value
      hp: hp int value
      mp: mp int value
      spd: spd int value
```

If you want to provide actual integer values for the `stats`, it would look like this:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: 10
      def: 20
      hp: 30
      mp: 40
      spd: 50
```

But based on the original input, there are no errors to fix.
