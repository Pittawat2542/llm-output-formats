The original YAML data is correct. There seems to be an issue with the backticks (`), but they are not present in the provided YAML. The data is properly formatted, so no corrections are needed.

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: A dragon.
    id: 1
    name: A dragon.
    stats:
      atk: 20
      def: 20
      hp: 20
      mp: 20
      spd: 20
```
