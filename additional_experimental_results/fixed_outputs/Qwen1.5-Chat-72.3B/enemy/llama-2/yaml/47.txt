The provided YAML data seems to be correct. Here it is again in a code block:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: 10
      def: 10
      hp: 10
      mp: 10
      spd: 10
```

If you intended to provide actual values for the `description`, `id`, and `name` fields, please replace those placeholders with the desired strings.
