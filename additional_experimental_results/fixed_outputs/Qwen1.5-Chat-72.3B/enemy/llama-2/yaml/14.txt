There seems to be a misunderstanding in the provided test and example. The original YAML data is already correct, and there's no need for any change or fixing. Here it is again for clarity:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    id: 1
    name: "Flygon"
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 100
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100
```

If the intention was to add a `description` field, it should be specified as shown in the example. But since the original YAML is already valid, no changes are needed.
