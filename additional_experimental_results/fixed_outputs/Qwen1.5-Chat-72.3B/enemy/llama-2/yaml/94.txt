```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "The enemy is a random creature that can be found in the world."
    id: "12345"
    name: "Enemy"
    stats:
      atk: 200
      def: 150
      hp: 100
      mp: 20
      spd: 30
```
The issue was that the values for `atk`, `def`, `hp`, `mp`, and `spd` were quoted as strings. In YAML, integer values should not be enclosed in quotes. I have removed the quotes to fix the syntax.
