```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 100
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100
```

The original YAML data seemed to have a formatting error caused by a backtick (`) at the end of line 12. This character was not part of the correct YAML syntax, so I removed it in the fixed version provided above. The rest of the structure appeared to be valid, so no other changes were necessary.
