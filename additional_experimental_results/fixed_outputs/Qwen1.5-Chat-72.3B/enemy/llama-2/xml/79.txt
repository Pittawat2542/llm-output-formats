```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<enemy>
		<id>1</id>
		<name>Human</name>
		<description>Human</description>
		<stats>
			<hp>100</hp>
			<mp>100</mp>
			<atk>100</atk>
			<def>100</def>
			<spd>100</spd>
		</stats>
	</enemy>
</game>
```
The issue in the original XML was a typo in the closing `</stats>` tag, which had an extra forward slash. I fixed this by removing the extra slash. The rest of the XML is well-formed and does not require any further changes.
