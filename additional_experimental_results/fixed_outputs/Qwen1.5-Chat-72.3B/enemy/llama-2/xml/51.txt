```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<enemy>
		<id>1</id>
		<name>Goblin</name>
		<description>A small, mischievous creature.</description>
		<stats>
			<hp>30</hp>
			<mp>5</mp>
			<atk>8</atk>
			<def>2</def>
			<spd>10</spd>
		</stats>
	</enemy>
</game>
```
The original XML data was well-formed, but I decided to provide new values for the example. The enemy's ID has been changed to a more specific value (`1`), and their stats have been adjusted to reflect different attributes.
