The original YAML data provided is already correct and does not need any syntax fixes. Here it is in the requested format with a line break between each property and the equal sign:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: A fierce enemy
    id: 123
    name: Dragon
    stats:
      atk: 50
      def: 30
      hp: 100
      mp: 40
      spd: 60
```

You can modify the values as needed, but the syntax is now formatted according to your preference.
