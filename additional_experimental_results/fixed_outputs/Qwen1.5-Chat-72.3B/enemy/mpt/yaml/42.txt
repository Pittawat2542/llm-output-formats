The provided YAML data is correct. Here it is again in a code block:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: atk int value
      def: def int value
      hp: hp int value
      mp: mp int value
      spd: spd int value
```

There were no syntax errors or issues with the values. It's ready to be used as a YAML snippet.
