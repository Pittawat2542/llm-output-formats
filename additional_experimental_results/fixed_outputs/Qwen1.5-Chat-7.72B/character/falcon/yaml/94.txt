The original YAML code has some issues with formatting and duplicate keys. Here's the corrected YAML, removing the unnecessary duplication for the `id` field and adding a valid value for one of the attributes (`eye_color`):

```yaml
game:
  character:
    name:
      first_name: first name
      last_name: last_name
      age: exact age or description
      background: background story
      physical_appearance:
        - eye_color: eye color (e.g., `green`)
          hair_color: hair color
          height: height in float value
          weight: weight in float value
    place_of_birth: location
    role: role of the character
    species: species
```

Output in YAML format:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    name:
      first_name: John Doe
      last_name: Smith
      age: 35
      background: Grew up on a spaceship
      physical_appearance:
        - eye_color: green
          hair_color: brown
          height: 1.8ç±³
          weight: 70kg
    place_of_birth: Earth
    role: Main protagonist
    species: Human
```
