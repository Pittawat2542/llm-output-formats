```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: exact age or description (updated)
    background: background story
    first_name: John Doe (new value)
    id: 123456 (new value, assuming an ID)
    last_name: Smith (new value)
    physical_appearance:
    - eye_color: blue
      hair_color: brown
      height: 72.0 (updated to a float value)
      weight: 180.0 (also updated to a float value)
    place_of_birth: New York City (new value)
    role: main protagonist (kept as is)
    species: human (kept as is)
```
The YAML code block above has been fixed by adding `exact age or description` to the `age` key, updating some values with proper syntax (`eye_color`, `hair_color`, `height`, and `weight`), and providing new values for `first_name`, `id`, and `last_name`.
