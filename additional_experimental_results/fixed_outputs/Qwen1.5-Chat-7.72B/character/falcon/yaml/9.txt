Here's the corrected YAML data with new values provided where necessary:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: "30" # Exact age
    background: "Grew up in a small town"
    first_name: "Alice"
    id: "12345"
    last_name: "Smith"
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: "blue"
        hair_color: "blonde"
        height: 1.75
        weight: 60.0
    place_of_birth: "Springfield, USA"
    role: "Protagonist"
    species: "Human"
```

The original message was missing some data and had incorrect syntax with the single quote (`) around the age value. I've fixed those issues and added new values for `first_name`, `id`, and `physical_appearance`. Now the YAML is in a valid format.
