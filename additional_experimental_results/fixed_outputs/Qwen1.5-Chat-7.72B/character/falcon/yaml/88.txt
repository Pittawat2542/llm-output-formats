```yaml
game.character:
  First_name: John Doe
  Last_name: Doe
  age: 30
  place_of_birth: San Francisco
  physical_appearance:
    - eye_color: Blue
      hair_color: Brown
      height: 5.10
      weight: 120
```
The YAML data has been fixed by removing the incorrect `array` and `-` syntax for physical appearance, and replacing it with a single item dictionary. The age value is now a single scalar without the unnecessary parentheses. Here's the corrected YAML in a code block:

```yaml
game.character:
  First_name: John Doe
  Last_name: Doe
  age: 30
  place_of_birth: San Francisco
  physical_appearance:
    eye_color: Blue
    hair_color: Brown
    height: 5.10
    weight: 120
```
