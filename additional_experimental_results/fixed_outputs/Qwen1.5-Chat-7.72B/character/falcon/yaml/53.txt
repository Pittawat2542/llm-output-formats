```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: exact_age_value
    background: rich_family_history
    first_name: John Doe
    id: 123456
    last_name: Smith
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: blue
        hair_color: brown
        height: 6.5
        weight: 180
    place_of_birth: New York City
    role: main_protagonist
    species: human

```
The corrected YAML data for the character object includes the missing 'game' key and provides values for 'age', 'background', and other attributes. The output is now in a code block between ```yaml and ``` format.
