Here is the corrected YAML data with proper syntax and updated values where necessary:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: "exact age in years" | age (with optional months) or "age in years and months"
    physical_appearance:
      eye_color: "eye color in text"
      hair_color: "hair color in text"
      height: "height in decimal value"
      weight: "weight in decimal value"

    place_of_birth: "City, Country"
    role: "主角/反派"
    species: "人类/精灵/矮人"

```
The changes made include:

1. Replacing the invalid `` character with proper quotes for string values.
2. Removing the `|bold` in front of attributes to make them plain text (except for age, which still allows a format).
3. Updating the description for age and height to match the expected format.
4. Changing the place_of_birth value from a `unicode string` to a more specific format.
5. Simplifying the role and species descriptions by removing the extra `|bold`.
