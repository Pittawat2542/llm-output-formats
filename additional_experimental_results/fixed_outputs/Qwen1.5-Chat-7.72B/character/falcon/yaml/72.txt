```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: exact_age_value
    background: background_story
    first_name: first_name
    id: character_id
    last_name: last_name
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: eye_color
        hair_color: hair_color
        height: 5.9
        weight: weight_in_float
    place_of_birth: location
    role: character_role
    species: species_name
```
The fixed YAML code block replaces the incorrect syntax with proper key-value pairs and separates the physical appearance data into a list. The age value is changed to `exact_age_value` and each appearance property has a consistent format.
