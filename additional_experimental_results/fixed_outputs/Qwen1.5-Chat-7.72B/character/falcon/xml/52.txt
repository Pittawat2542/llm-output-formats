Here's the corrected XML with new values for some elements where empty or incorrect data were present:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
    <character>
        <id>12345</id>
        <first-name>Jane Doe</first-name>
        <last-name>Doe</last-name>
        <speciesHuman</species>
        <age>30</age>
        <role>Chef</role>
        <background>A passionate cook who grew up in a small village by the sea.</background>
        <place-of-birth>London, England</place-of-birth>
        <physical-appearance>
            <height>1.75</height>
            <weight>68.0</weight>
            <eye-colorBrown</eye-color>
            <hair-colorBlonde</hair-color>
        </physical-appearance>
    </character>
</game>
```

The `id` element was changed to a numerical value (`12345`). The `species` had an empty value, so I added `"Human"` for this example. The `eye-color` and `hair-color` were provided with new values.
