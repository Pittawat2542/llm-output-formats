            Eira was born in the small village of Oakwood on the edge of a kingdom to a human father and an elven mother. She learned stealth and agility from her mother, who was a skilled huntress. Disillusioned with the village's rules, she left for a life of adventure and sought riches.

The XML code block is now corrected, with proper indentation and closing tags for the `<background>` element. The content within `<background>` has also been reformatted for readability.
