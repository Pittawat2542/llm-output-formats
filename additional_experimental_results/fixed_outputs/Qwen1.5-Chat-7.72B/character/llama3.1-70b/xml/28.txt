            Eira was born in Oakwood Village to a human father and an elven mother. She grew up learning stealth and agility from her elf mother, who was a skilled huntress. As she became interested in assassination, Eira left her village to join "The Shadowhand" for advanced training.</background>

I've fixed the incorrect syntax by adding the encoding attribute to the XML declaration and indenting the `background` element properly. I also removed the unnecessary `<physical-appearance>` within the `character` tag since it was already enclosed in a separate block, which simplifies the XML structure.
