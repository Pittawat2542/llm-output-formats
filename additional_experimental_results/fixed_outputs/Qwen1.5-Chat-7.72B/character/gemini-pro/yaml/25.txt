```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: exact_age (e.g., 30)
    background: A skilled engineer and pilot with a no-nonsense approach to solving problems.
    first_name: Lea
    id: 1001
    last_name: Weston
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: blue
        hair_color: dark
        height: 1.78
        weight: 72.5
    place_of_birth: Earth
    role: Fleet Engineer
    species: Human
```
The corrected YAML data has the following changes:

1. Removed extra spaces in "last_name": Weston.
2. Changed "physical_appearance" to a list with items, using `-` for indentation and adding specific properties (eye_color, hair_color, height, weight).
3. Added a missing colon (`:`) after "age".
