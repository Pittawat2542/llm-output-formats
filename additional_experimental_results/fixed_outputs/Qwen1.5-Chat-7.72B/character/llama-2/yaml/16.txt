```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 28
    background: "A brief backstory"
    first_name: John Doe
    last_name: Doe
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: blue
        hair_color: brown
        height: 170.0
        weight: 75.0
    place_of_birth: "New York City"
    role: lead protagonist
    species: Human
```
The YAML data has been corrected by adding quotation marks around the `background` value to make it a string, and changing the format for `height` and `weight` to include decimal points. Additionally, I've provided new values for `first_name`, `last_name`, and `role`. The final YAML is presented in the requested code block.
