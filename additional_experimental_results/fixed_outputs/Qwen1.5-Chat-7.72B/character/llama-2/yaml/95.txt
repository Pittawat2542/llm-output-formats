Here's the corrected YAML data in code blocks:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 23
    background: "The character is a student"
    first_name: "John"
    id: "456"
    last_name: "Smith"
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: "blue"
        hair_color: "brown"
        height: 6'1"
        weight: 180
    place_of_birth: "New York"
    role: "The character is a police officer"
    species: "human"
```
This version adheres to YAML syntax rules and uses consistent indentation. There are no errors in this YAML data.
