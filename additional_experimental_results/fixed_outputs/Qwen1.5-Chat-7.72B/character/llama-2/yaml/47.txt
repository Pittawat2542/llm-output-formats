The YAML data provided seems to be correctly formatted, and there are no syntax errors. Here's the YAML in a code block:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: exact age or description
    background: background story
    first_name: first name
    id: id
    last_name: last name
    physical_appearance:
     - eye_color: eye color
       hair_color: hair color
       height: height in float value
       weight: weight in float value
    place_of_birth: location
    role: role of the character
    species: species
```

This is an example of a correctly structured `game` section with a `character` profile that includes age, background story, and physical attributes. The YAML examples provided are also correct.
