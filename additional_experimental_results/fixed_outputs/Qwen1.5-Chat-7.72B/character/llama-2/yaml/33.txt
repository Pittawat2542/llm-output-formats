Here is the correct YAML data without any syntax issues:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 35
    background: "The character is a former criminal and is skilled in stealth operations."
    first_name: John
    id: "0001"
    last_name: Smith
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: brown
        hair_color: brown
        height: 180.0
        weight: 75.0
    place_of_birth: New York
    role: villain
    species: human
```
I made the following changes to fix the syntax:

1. Removed backticks around strings, which are not necessary in YAML.
2. Changed "height" and "weight" values to use floating-point numbers (e.g., 180.0 instead of 180).
3. Indented the appearance entries for consistency with other properties.
