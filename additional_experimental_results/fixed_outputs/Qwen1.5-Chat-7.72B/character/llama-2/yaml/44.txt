Here is the corrected YAML data:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 25
    background: I was raised by a family of dragons.
    first_name: Lance
    id: 101
    last_name: McLovin
    physical_appearance:
    - eye_color: brown
      hair_color: blonde
      height: 5'6"
      weight: 120
    place_of_birth: Earth
    role: The main character
    species: Human
```
The issue was a missing colon after the `-` in the `physical_appearance` list. Now, it is properly formatted and all values are correct.
