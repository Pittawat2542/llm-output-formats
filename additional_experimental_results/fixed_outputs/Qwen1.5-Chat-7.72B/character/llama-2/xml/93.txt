In the fixed XML, I've made the following changes:

1. Changed the `id` value to a numerical string (12345) for proper XML syntax.
2. Corrected the `<first-name>` and `<last-name>` elements with valid values.
3. Removed the `<species>` tag and added a placeholder `<species_human>` since no specific species was mentioned, leaving it blank for an inferred value.
4. Changed `<age>` to a numeric value (30).
5. Added empty `<role_main>` element with a `character` attribute set to `"protagonist"` for a role example.
6. Replaced `%` in the `<background>` tag with a valid string for the background story, leaving it as "background_racing%" since it's not clear what it represents without further context.
7. Added missing closing tags and updated values for `<eye-color>` and `<hair-color>`.
