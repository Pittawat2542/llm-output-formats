Explanation:

- Changed `<first-name>` to `<first-name>Jedi Knight` (added quotes and proper value)
- Changed `<last-name>` to `<last-name>Smith` (same as above)
- Added a valid `<age>` with numerical value
- Updated the `<role>` to `<role>Main Protagonist`
- Made `<background>` a string with a provided value
- Changed `<place-of-birth>` to `<place-of-birth>Theed City` (kept it short and clear)
- Reformatted `<physical-appearance>` tags, added missing closing tag for `<height>`, and fixed the `hair-color` attribute value to use `<hair-color>` instead of `<hair-colorBrown>` (which is a more consistent XML syntax) with proper capitalization.
