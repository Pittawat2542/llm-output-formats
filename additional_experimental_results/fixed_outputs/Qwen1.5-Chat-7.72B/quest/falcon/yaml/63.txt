```yaml
game:
  description: "Quest Description"
  id: "quest_id"
  objective: "Quest Objective"
  quest_giver: "Quest Giver"
  reward: "Quest Reward"
  tasks:
  - description: "Task Description"
    location: "Task Location"
    objective: "Task Objective"
    order: "1"
  title: "Quest Title"

# Start of game information
start_game:
  - event: "Game Start"
```
The corrected YAML data is provided below. I removed the asterisks (`*`) from the start of the "Game Start" section and replaced them with a proper key, `start_game`. The indentation for the tasks has been fixed as well. Note that I've added a new value for `event` in the `start_game` section to replace the placeholder.
