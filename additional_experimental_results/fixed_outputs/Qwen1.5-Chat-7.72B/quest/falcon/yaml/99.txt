```yaml
game:
  description: "A quest with multiple objectives and tasks"
  id: quest_id
  objective: "Complete objectives to earn the reward"
  quest_giver: QuestGiverName
  reward: "Gold coins, Experience points, or an item"
  tasks:
  - description: "Find the ancient artifact at Mount Shadow"
    location: "MountShadow"
    objective: "Collect the artifact"
    order: 1
  title: "The Mysterious Expedition"

```
I have corrected the YAML syntax by indenting the key-value pairs correctly and adding missing values like `quest_giver`, `reward`, and `objective`. I also simplified the description of the quest and tasks for clarity. The output is now in a valid YAML format.
