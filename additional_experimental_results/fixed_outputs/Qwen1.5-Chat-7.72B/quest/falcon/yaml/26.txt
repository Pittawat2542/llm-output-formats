```yaml
game:
  description: Your quest description
  title: Quest Title
  objective: Quest Objective
  quest_giver: Quest Giver
  reward: Quest Reward
  tasks:
    - description: Task Description
      location: Task Location
      objective: Task Objective
      order: Task Order

quests:
  id: Quest_ID
```
The fixed YAML data includes the missing keys and correct syntax. The `title`, `objective`, `quest_giver`, `reward`, and `tasks` keys have been added, and a sample value for `id` has been provided in the `quests` section.
