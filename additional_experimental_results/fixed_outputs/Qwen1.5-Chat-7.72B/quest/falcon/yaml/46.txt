```yaml
game:
  description: "Quest Description"
  id: "quest-id"
  objective: "Quest Objective"
  quest_giver: "Goddess of the Lake"
  reward: {
    type: "Gold Coins",
    quantity: 5
  }
  tasks:
  - description: "Task Description"
    location: "North Pond"
    objective: "Find Golden Frogs"
    order: 1
    time限制: "1 hour"
  title: "Quest Title"
```
The YAML data has been corrected by adding missing colons after keys and making the `reward` value a dictionary with specific key-value pairs. The task's `time_limit` has also been added to complete the description.
