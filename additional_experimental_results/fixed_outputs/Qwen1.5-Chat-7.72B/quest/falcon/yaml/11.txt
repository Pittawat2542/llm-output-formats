```yaml
game:
  description: quest description
  id: my_unique_identifier
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest_giver
  reward: quest_reward
  tasks:
    - description: task description
      location: task_location
      objective: task_objective
      order: task_order
    - title: quest_title # moved the title to its own line
```
In the corrected YAML, I've fixed the syntax issues by adding missing colons and moving the `title` to a new line. The `id` value has been changed to a more descriptive one for clarity.
