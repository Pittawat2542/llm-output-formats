```
game:
  description: "quest description"
  id: "1-12"
  objective: "quest objective"
  quest_giver: "![](https://example.com/people/1-12)"
  reward: "quest reward"
  tasks:
  - description: "task description"
    location: "https://example.com/location"
    objective: "task objective"
    order: "task order"
  - description: "task description"
    location: "task location"
    objective: "task objective"
    order: "task order"
  title: "quest title"

[(tasks)]
  - description: ""
    location: ""
```
The YAML code block has been fixed by adding missing values and correcting the syntax for the `quest_giver` field. Also, I've added empty strings for descriptions since they were missing in the task list. The format is now consistent with other keys.
