The original YAML data seems to have some inconsistent keys and missing values. Here's the corrected YAML with consistent key names and added values where necessary:

```yaml
game:
  title: quest title
  description: quest description
  objective: quest objective
  giver: quest_giver
  giver_id: quest_giver_id
  reward: quest_reward
  tasks:
  - task_title: task description
    location: task_location
    objective: task_objective
    order: task_order
    task_type: specific_task_type (optional, depending on context)
  exploration_location: explore_location

# Output format
```yaml
