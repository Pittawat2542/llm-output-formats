```yaml
game:
  description: quest description
  id: quest_id
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: NPC_Name
  reward: gold, items
  tasks:
    - description: task description
      location: task_location
      objective: complete_task
      order: 1
      details:
        - subtask1_description
        - subtask2_action

title: Quest Title
```
In the fixed YAML, I added the missing key 'game' with appropriate values for `id`, `quest_giver`, and `reward`. Also, I corrected the task description to remove the `-` at the beginning and included a `details` section for nested subtasks.
