Here's the corrected XML data with new values for the missing elements:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
    <id>1234567890</id>
    <title>Quest for the Ancient Amulet</title>
    <objective>Find the Amulet and defeat the Dragon at Mount Eternity</objective>
    <description>Uncover the hidden treasure by solving riddles in the forest and facing the treacherous goblin tribe.</description>
    <reward>Golden Amulet, 100 gold coins, and a rare magical potion</reward>
    <quest-giver>Old Sage at the Village Inn</quest-giver>
    <tasks>
        <task order="1">
            <objective>Deliver the enchanted scroll to the goblin chieftain</objective>
            <description>Follow the path marked by the tree with three leaves and avoid the traps</description>
            <location>Goblin Camp, north of the forest boundary</location>
        </task>
        
        <task order="2">
            <objective>Retrieve the key from the chest in the cave</objective>
            <description>Climb to the top of Mount Eternity and find the hidden niche with the key</description>
            <location>Cave entrance, near the base of the mountain</location>
        </task>
    </tasks>
</game>
```
The XML structure has been fixed, elements have been added where necessary (like `<id>`, `<title>`, `<objective>`), and new values provided for `quest id` (`1234567890`), `quest title`, `task objectives`, and `reward`.
