The XML has been corrected with the following changes:
- Added a correct closing tag for `<id>`
- Changed `quest objective` to `new_quest_objective`, and provided new value for `<objective>`
- Changed `quast description` to `new_quest_description`, and provided new value for `<description>`
- Changed `quest reward` to `new_quest_reward`, and provided new value for `<reward>`
- Changed `qastion` to `quest_giver`, and corrected the closing tag
- Added a new `<task>` with sample data for task 1, and added missing closing tags for `<task>`. You can add more tasks as needed.
