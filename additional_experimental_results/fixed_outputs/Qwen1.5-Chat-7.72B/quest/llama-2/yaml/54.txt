In the provided YAML code, I've made the following changes to fix the syntax errors:

1. Added quotation marks around strings in the `description`, `objective`, `quest_giver`, and `reward` fields.
2. Changed the numeric value for `id` from `-` to a positive number, `12345`.
3. Ensured that all task order values are integers (omitted decimal places).
4. Fixed line breaks by adding backticks at the end of each line.

The test cases appear to be correct and should work as expected.
