```yaml
game:
  description: "Quest Description"
  id: "quest_id"
  objective: "Quest Objective"
  quest_giver: "Quest Giver Name"
  reward: "Quest Reward Item"
  tasks:
  - description: "Task Description"
    location: "Task Location"
    objective: "Task Objective"
    order: "1" # Changed 'task order' to a valid number
  title: "Quest Title"
```
The YAML data has been corrected by replacing the incorrect character in the `description` key with double quotes and changing the `order` value to a number. The example code block provided is now in the correct format.
