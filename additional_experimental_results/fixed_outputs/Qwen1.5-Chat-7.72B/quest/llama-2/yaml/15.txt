The YAML syntax in your example is correct, but there were some unnecessary single quotes around the values. I've removed them for better readability. The YAML data as requested is:

```yaml
game:
  description: A quest to find the treasure
  id: 1
  objective: Find the treasure
  quest_giver: The King
  reward: 1000 gold
  tasks:
    - description: Find the treasure
      location: The king's castle
      objective: Find the treasure
      order: 1
    - description: Find the treasure
      location: The king's castle
      objective: Find the treasure
      order: 2
    - description: Find the treasure
      location: The king's castle
      objective: Find the treasure
      order: 3
    - description: Find the treasure
      location: The king's castle
      objective: Find the treasure
      order: 4
  title: A quest to find the treasure
```
Now the output is in a code block as requested.
