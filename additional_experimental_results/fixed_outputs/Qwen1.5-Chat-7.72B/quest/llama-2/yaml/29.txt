```yaml
game:
  description: "Updated quest description"
  id: "updated_id"
  objective: "New quest objective"
  quest_giver: "New quest giver"
  reward: "Rewards updated"
  tasks:
    - description: "Task description updated"
      location: "Task location updated"
      objective: "Task objective updated"
      order: "Task order number"
      title: "Updated quest title"
```
The YAML in the markdown code block is corrected with updated task description and ids.
