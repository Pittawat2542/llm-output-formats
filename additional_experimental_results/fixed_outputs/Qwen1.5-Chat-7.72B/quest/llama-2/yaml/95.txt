In the fixed YAML, I've made the following changes:

1. Corrected the syntax for aliases by replacing `*` with `-` and adding quotes around values.
2. Added missing quotation marks to make the keys strings.
3. Changed the example values for clarity and added a unique quest ID (`quest_id12345`).
4. Ensured all other fields have valid values.
