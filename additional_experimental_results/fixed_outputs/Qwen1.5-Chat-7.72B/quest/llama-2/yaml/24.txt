In the fixed YAML code, I've made the following changes:

1. Corrected quotes around descriptions to maintain YAML format.
2. Removed backticks (`) from the beginning of the `bash` line (since it's not a shell command in this context).
3. Added proper string values for `id`, `quest_giver`, and removed extra spaces.
4. Changed `tasks` to an array with multiple items.
5. Added new task entries with their respective descriptions, locations, objectives, and order numbers.
