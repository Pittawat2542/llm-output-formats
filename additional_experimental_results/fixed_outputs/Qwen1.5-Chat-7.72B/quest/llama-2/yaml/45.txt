Here is the corrected YAML with the missing closing square bracket in the `/INST` key:

```yaml
game:
  description: quest description
  id: id
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
   - description: task description
    location: task location
    objective: task objective
    order: task order
  title: quest title
```[^/INST]

[^/INST]: Removed the extra `/INST` in the last line as it was not required and caused the syntax error.
