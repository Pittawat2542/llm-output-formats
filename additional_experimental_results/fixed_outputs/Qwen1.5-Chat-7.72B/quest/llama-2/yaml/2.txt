game:
  description: "This is a description for the quest."
  id: 1
  objective: "To complete this quest, you must find the object."
  quest_giver: "The quest giver"
  reward: "You will receive a reward for completing it."
  tasks:
   - description: "Search for the item in the specified location."
     location: "A hidden chest in the forest"
     objective: "Locate and collect the item"
     order: 1
     title: "Objective: Find Chest"
```
The YAML data has been fixed by removing the extra backticks around the strings and providing correct values for `reward` and a description for one of the tasks.
