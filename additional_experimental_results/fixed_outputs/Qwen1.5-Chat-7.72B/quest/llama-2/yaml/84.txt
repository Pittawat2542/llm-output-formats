The YAML code provided in the original message is actually correct and does not contain any syntax errors. It's a complete valid YAML file for defining a quest with game details.

Since there's no issue to fix, here's the YAML in a code block:

```yaml
game:
  description: quest description
  id: 24
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
  - description: task description
    location: task location
    objective: task objective
    order: task order
  title: quest title
```
