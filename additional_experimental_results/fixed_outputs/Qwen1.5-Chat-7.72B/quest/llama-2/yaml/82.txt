```yaml
game:
  description: quest description
  id: "unique_id"
  objective: "quest_objective"
  quest_giver: "NPC_name"
  reward: "reward_description"
  tasks:
    - description: "task_description"
      location: "task_location"
      objective: "task_objective"
      order: "1"
    title: "quest_title"

# Optional fields with example values
game:
  additional_fields:
    game.tasks.description: "Extended task description"
    game.tasks.location: "Specific area within the realm"
    game.tasks.objective: "Challenge completion goal"
    game.tasks.order: "2"
```
The YAML data has been corrected. I removed the invalid backtick character (`) and added missing values like `id` with a unique value, `quest_giver` with a string, `reward` with a description, and example values for optional fields.
