The YAML syntax in the provided message has a few issues. Here's the corrected YAML code block:

```yaml
game:
  description: A quest to find the lost treasure.
  id: 12345 # Change this ID to a valid number or string
  objective: Discover the hidden treasure
  quest_giver: The Great Archaeologist
  reward: An ancient artifact
  tasks:
    - description: Explore the dense forest
      location: Woodland Path
      objective: Search for clues
      order: 1
    - description: Cross the rickety bridge
      location: Bridge Over River
      objective: Reach the other side
      order: 2
    # ... (rest of the tasks with proper indentation and removed unnecessary repetition)

title: The Quest for the Lost Treasure
```
Please make sure to replace `12345` in the `id` field with a valid unique identifier if needed. If there are no specific changes required, you can return this YAML as is.
