The original YAML code is already correct. There are no syntax errors or issues that need fixing. Here's the YAML data in a code block:

```yaml
game:
  description: quest description
  id: id
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
   - description: task description
    location: task location
    objective: task objective
    order: task order
  title: quest title
```
