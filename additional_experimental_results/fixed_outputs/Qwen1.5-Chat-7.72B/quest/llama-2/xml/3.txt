The provided XML code has some errors and missing elements. Here's the corrected version:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?> 
<game>
    <id>12345</id>
    <title>The Quest of the LostTreasure</title>
    <objective>Find the treasure hidden in the ancient ruins</objective>
    <description>A challenging adventure awaits you!</description>
    <reward>Gold coins and a mysterious artifact</reward>
    <quest-giver>Local Elder</quest-giver>
    <tasks>
        <task order="1">
            <objective>Uncover the first clue at the old library</objective>
            <description>Search for a map with a hidden symbol</description>
            <location>Library, Room 345</location>
        </task>
        <!-- Additional tasks can be added here -->
    </tasks>
</game>
```

I made the following changes:
1. Removed the incorrect `<QUESTION>` tag and replaced it with the root `<game>`.
2. Set a unique `id` value for the game (`12345`, you can replace this with any valid number).
3. Corrected the element names (e.g., `<title>`, `<objective>`, etc.) to match the correct XML syntax.
4. Added `<task>` elements, each with an `order` attribute and other required fields like `objective`, `description`, and `location`.
5. Closed tags properly, where necessary.

This is the corrected XML format in Markdown code block.
