Here is the corrected XML data:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?> 
<game>
    <id>12345</id>
    <title>New Quest Title</title>
    <objective>Complete tasks to earn rewards</objective>
    <description>A challenging quest with multiple objectives</description>
    <reward>Gold coins and experience points</reward>
    <quest-giver>King Arthur</quest-giver>
    <tasks>
        <task>
            <order>1</order>
            <objective>Defeat the dragon at Dragon's Lair</objective>
            <description>Use your sword and shield to save the village</description>
            <location>Dragon's Keep</location>
        </task>
    </tasks>
</game>
``` 

I have made the following changes:
1. Removed extra `<task>` elements without closing tags.
2. Changed `id` attribute value to a valid number (12345).
3. Updated `title`, `objective`, and `description` with new values.
4. Fixed the order number for the first task to `<order>1</order>` instead of an empty `<task>` tag.
