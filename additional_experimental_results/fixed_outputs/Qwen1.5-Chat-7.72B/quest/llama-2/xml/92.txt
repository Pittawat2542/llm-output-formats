In this fixed XML, I have made the following changes:

1. Added `encoding="UTF-8"` to ensure proper encoding.
2. Changed `<id>` attribute value to a random integer (12345).
3. Updated the title and objective with example values.
4. Corrected the syntax for starting a new task element by wrapping it in `<task>` tags instead of `</task>`.
5. Added `<order>` for task order and filled in sample values.
6. Removed the extra `</task>` tag at the end of the `tasks` section.
