Here's the corrected XML data with new values for some elements:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
    <id>quest_id1234</id>
    <title>Escape from Serpentine Rock Temple</title>
    <objective>Complete puzzles and defeat the Guardian</objective>
    <description>Solve riddles, navigate treacherous terrain, and save the village from eternal drought.</description>
    <reward>Gold coins, rare artifact, and gratitude of the villagers</reward>
    <quest-giver>Old Wise Oak</quest-giver>
    <tasks>
        <task order="1">
            <objective>Find the ancient map in the village library</objective>
            <description>Ask the librarian for assistance and look for a hidden compartment</description>
            <location>Library, East Wing</location>
        </task>
        <task order="2">
            <objective>Decode the first clue at the well</objective>
            <description>Write down the sequence of symbols on the stone wall nearby</description>
            <location>Well, West Side</location>
        </task>
    </tasks>
</game>
```
In this example, I've changed the `id` attribute value to "quest_id1234" which is a valid format for an ID. Also, I provided new values for the title, objective, quest-giver, and task description. The task order numbers are also set correctly.
