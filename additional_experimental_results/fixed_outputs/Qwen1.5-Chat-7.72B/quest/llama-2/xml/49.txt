The XML code block has been corrected with the following changes:
- Replaced `id` attribute value (which was missing) with `12345` for demonstration purposes.
- Updated `<title>` to `"NewQuestTitle"`.
- Changed `<objective>` to a meaningful description.
- Fixed indentation and removed extra brackets in `<tasks>` and `<task>`.
