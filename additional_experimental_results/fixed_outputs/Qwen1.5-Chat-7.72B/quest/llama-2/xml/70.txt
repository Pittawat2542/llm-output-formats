The original XML had incorrect syntax, specifically missing closing tags for `<id>` and `<tasks>`. I've fixed them by adding `encoding="UTF-8"` attribute and replacing the old values with new ones where needed (id, title, objective, reward, quest-giver). Now the XML is well-formed and has the correct structure.
