```yaml
game:
  description: The Dark Sorcerer Xaren has stolen the magical crystal that maintains balance in nature. Restore the crystal and put an end to Xaren's evil plans.
  id: Q1
  objective: Retrieve the stolen magical crystal from Xaren's fortress
  quest_giver: The village elder, a wise and aged man named Thorold
  reward: A pair of enchanted daggers and a boost in reputation among the villagers
  tasks:
    - title: Gather Information on Xaren's Fortress
      description: Travel to the Dark Forest and meet with 'The Ranger' for details about Xaren's location.
      location: The Dark Forest
      objective: Obtain information on Xaren's lair
      order: 1
    - title: Sneak into Xaren's Fortress
      description: Infiltrate Xaren's fortress, bypass traps and fight minions to find the crystal.
      location: Xaren's Fortress

```
Now the YAML is corrected with a `title` for each task and removed the unnecessary quotes around the values.
