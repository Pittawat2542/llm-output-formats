The XML has been corrected with the following changes:

1. Added the `quest-giver` key with a value.
2. Changed the random task numbers to unique IDs (`id`).
3. Updated the `title`, `objective`, and `reward` values for better consistency.
4. Fixed indentation and formatting for proper XML structure.
