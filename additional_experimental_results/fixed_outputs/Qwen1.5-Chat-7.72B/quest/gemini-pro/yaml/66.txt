The YAML data has been fixed by creating two separate `game` blocks with proper keys, descriptions, and values. The second game (`game2`) also had some key changes like `quest_giver` being changed to `Merchant_Leadership` and `reward` having a different value format. The output is now in a YAML code block between ```yaml``` and ````.
