```yaml
game:
  description: "A mystical adventure quest"
  id: "quest_id123"
  objective: "Uncover the ancient treasure"
  quest_giver: "Mysterious Guide"
  reward: "Golden amulet and valuable artifacts"
  tasks:
    - description: "Track the enchanted map at the forbidden forest"
      location: "Forbidden Woods"
      objective: "Find the first clue hidden in a tree"
      order: "1"
    - description: "Speak to the wise old witch for the next step"
      location: "Old Witch's Cottage"
      objective: "换取第二张线索"
      order: "2"

```
The fixed YAML data now includes the missing 'game' key and corrects the values for description, id, quest_giver, reward, and adds a task example.
