In this fixed XML, I've changed the `id` attribute to `questID`, provided a new quest title and objective, updated descriptions, removed unnecessary content like "You will need to be a high level," and added specific task details. The quest giver's name is also provided as "King Richard the Wise" with a corresponding location for the first task.
