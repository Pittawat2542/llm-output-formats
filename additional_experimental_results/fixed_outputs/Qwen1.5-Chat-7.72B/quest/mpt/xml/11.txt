```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>

    <title>New Quest Title</title>
    <objective>New Quest Objective</objective>
    <description>New Quest Description</description>
    <reward>New Quest Reward</reward>
    <quest-giver>New Quest Giver</quest-giver>

            <objective>Task 1 Objective</objective>
            <description>Task 1 Description</description>
            <location>Task 1 Location</location>
        </task>
    </tasks>
</game>
```
The XML has been corrected by adding the 'game' element, removing unnecessary '<task>' within it (as there's only one task), and updating the values with new ones for easier reference. The output is in the requested XML format.
