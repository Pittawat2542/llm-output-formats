```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<game>
   <dialogues>
     <dialogue>
       <order>Dialogue Order 1.</order>
       <speaker>John Doe.</speaker>
       <text>Narration for the quest.</text>
     </dialogue>
   </dialogues>
</game>
```
The XML code block has been corrected with the following changes:

1. Added `encoding="utf-8"` to specify the character encoding.
2. Changed `speaker name.` to a proper format with spaces and capitalization (Speaker name.)
3. Added a new dialogue with example values: `order` as "Dialogue Order 1", `speaker` as "John Doe", and `text` as "Narration for the quest".
