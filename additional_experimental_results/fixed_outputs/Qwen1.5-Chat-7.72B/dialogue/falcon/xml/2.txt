In the fixed XML, I made the following changes:

1. Corrected the opening and closing tags: replaced `<dialogues>` with `<dialogues>` and removed extraneous `xmlns:` attributes.
2. Added a namespace for `xlsx` since it's defined twice (it's not needed in this case).
3. Changed the text content to valid values, like `Narration 1` for the first dialogue.
4. Indented the XML for readability.
5. Removed the `<xlswriter:` prefixes from text elements since they are unnecessary with the correct namespace.
