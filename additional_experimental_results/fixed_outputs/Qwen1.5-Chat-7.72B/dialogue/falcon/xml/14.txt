The XML code provided seems to have some formatting issues, but it's mostly correct. I've made a few adjustments to fix the missing closing tags and ensure proper syntax. Here's the corrected XML with new values for clarity:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?> 
<game>
    <dialogues>
        <dialogue>
            <dialogue.order>Dialog 1</dialogue.order>
            <speaker name="Alice">Alice</speaker>
            <speaker name="Bob">Bob</speaker>
            <text>"Bob explained the rules of chess to Alice, eager to play a game together."</text>
        </dialogue>
    </dialogues>
</game> 
```

The changes include:
- Changing `dialogue` to `dialogue.order` for the order attribute.
- Adding `<name>` tags to the speakers and assigning them the new values "Alice" and "Bob".
- Adding a closing tag for `<text>`.

Output in XML format:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?> 
<game>
    <dialogues>
        <dialogue>
            <dialogue.order>Dialog 1</dialogue.order>
            <speaker name="Alice">Alice</speaker>
            <speaker name="Bob">Bob</speaker>
            <text>"Bob explained the rules of chess to Alice, eager to play a game together."</text>
        </dialogue>
    </dialogues>
</game> 
```
