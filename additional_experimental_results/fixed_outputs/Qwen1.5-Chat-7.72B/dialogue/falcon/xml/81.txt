```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>dialogue order 1</order>
			<speaker>character name 1</speaker>
			<text>Narration 1</text>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue>
			<order>dialogue order 2</order>
			<speaker>character name 2</speaker>
			<text>Dialogue 2</text>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```
The XML code has been corrected with the following changes:
- Added a missing closing tag for `<dialogue>`
- Changed `dialogue or narration` to `Narration 1` and `Dialogue 2` as sample new values
- Ensured proper indentation for readability.
