Here's the corrected YAML data with proper syntax and new values if needed:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: 1
    speaker: Character A
    text: "First Dialogue"
  - order: 2
    speaker: Character B
    text: "Second Dialogue"
```
The original message seemed to be missing some indentation and newlines, so I've added them correctly with two dialogue examples. Each `-` represents a separate item in the `dialogues` array, with keys like `order`, `speaker`, and `text`.
