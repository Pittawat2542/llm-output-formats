Here's the corrected YAML data with proper syntax and new values if needed:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: 1
    speaker: Character A
    text: "Dialogue 1"
  - order: 2
    speaker: Character B
    text: "Dialogue 2"
```
In this version, I've removed the unnecessary duplicate `text` key and provided new values for `speaker` with actual character names. The dialogues are now listed as separate items in the `dialogues` list.
