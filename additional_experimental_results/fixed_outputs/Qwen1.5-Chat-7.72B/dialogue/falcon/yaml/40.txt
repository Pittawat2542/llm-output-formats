Here's the corrected YAML code block without any errors:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: "Dialogue Order 1"
      speaker: "Speaker Name 1"
      text: " Dialogue Text 1"
    - order: "Dialogue Order 2"
      speaker: "Speaker Name 2"
      text: " Dialogue Text 2"
```

In this YAML, I've reformatted the dialogues section with proper indentation and added new values for `order` and `speaker`. Each dialogue item now has a unique order number and speaker name.
