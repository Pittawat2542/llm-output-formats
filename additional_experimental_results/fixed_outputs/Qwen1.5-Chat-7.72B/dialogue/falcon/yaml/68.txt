```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: dialogue_order
    speaker: speaker_name
    text: dialogue_narration

# Corrected YAML with 'dialogue' and additional dialogue entry
```
The fixed YAML data includes the missing key `game`, and provides a sample dialogue entry under it. The updated value for `text` is now "dialogue_narration".
