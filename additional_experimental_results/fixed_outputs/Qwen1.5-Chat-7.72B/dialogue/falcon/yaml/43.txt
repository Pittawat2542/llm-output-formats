```yaml
# Backstory
on_found_in_wilderness:
  initial_speeches:
    - order: 1
      speaker: Gavin
      text: "Hey man, this really sucks. Don't you think?"
    - order: 2
      speaker: Ioren
      text: "Absolutely overwhelming, no question."

# Dialogues
dialogue_list:
- order: 3
  speaker: Yuri
  text: "Let's brainstorm a plan to get out of here."
- order: 4
  speaker: Gavin (revised)
  text: "I'm ready to listen! What do you suggest?"

```
The YAML code block with corrections is provided above. I fixed the syntax issue by separating the backstory into a `on_found_in_wilderness` section and moved the dialogue to an ordered list under `dialogue_list`. The speaker names for the dialogues have been updated as well, making the data clear and valid YAML.
