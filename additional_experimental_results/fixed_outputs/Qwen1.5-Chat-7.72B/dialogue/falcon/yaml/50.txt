```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: dialogue_order
    speaker: speaker_name
    text: 'dialogue_text, for example "spoken"'
```
The YAML code block is corrected by removing the comma after `order` and adding quotes around `text` to make it a string value. The key completeness issue is resolved since the root of the result is now a dictionary with a single key `dialogues`.
