```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: dialogue_order
    speaker: speaker_name
    text: dialogue_text_here
```
The corrected YAML code block now has proper indentation and a valid list structure for the `dialogues` key. The `order` value is renamed to `dialogue_order`, and an example `text` value is provided.
