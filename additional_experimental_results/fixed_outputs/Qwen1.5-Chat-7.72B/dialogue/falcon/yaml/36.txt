Here's the corrected YAML data with proper syntax and new values if necessary:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: 1
      speaker: Alice
      text: I'm Alice!

    - order: 2
      speaker: Bob
      text: Hello Bob!

    - order: 3
      speaker: Charlie
      text: Hi Charles!
```

In the fixed YAML, each dialogue is now a separate item with `order`, `speaker`, and `text` keys. The values have been changed to integers for the order (starting from 1) and proper names for the speakers. There's no need to use `-` to indicate each entry since YAML supports block mapping directly with key-value pairs.
