```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: dialogue_order
     speaker: John
     text: "John: Hi. Jane: Hey John. John: Thanks Jane!"
```
The corrected YAML data includes a new key 'dialogues' with a value containing a dialogue entry. The key 'order', 'speaker', and 'text' have been updated to follow the correct syntax for a dialogue in YAML.
