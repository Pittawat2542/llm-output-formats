The original YAML data was missing the correct syntax for mapping keys and values. Here's the corrected YAML with new values for the `text` key:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text:
      type: quote
      quote: "Dialogue. And I quote a quote."
```
The change includes adding `- type: quote` to specify the `quote` as a type within the `text` field, and replacing `" Dialogue. And I quote a quote."` with the actual `quote` value.
