```yaml
classDialogue:
  game:
    dialogues:
      - order: dialogue_order
        speaker: speaker_name
        text: dialogue_or_narration

```
The YAML has been fixed by adding a top-level key `game` and defining the `dialogues` list under it. The key name `dialogue` has also been changed to `dialogues` according to the original template.
