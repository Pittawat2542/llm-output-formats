```yaml
---
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: dialogue_order
    speaker: speaker_name
    text: |
      Dialogue 1:
        - This can be customized and moved around as needed
        - Use appropriate text editor commands
        - Markdown format for easy manipulation

      Dialogue 2:
        # Example YAML.d file content
        lines: 8

# Updated YAML code block
```
The fixed YAML data has the following changes:

1. Removed backticks (`) from within strings, as they were causing the error.
2. Indented the `game` key and its contents properly to conform to YAML syntax.
3. Created a new dialogue with the specified `order`, `speaker`, and `text`.
4. Added an example YAML.d file content under the dialogue with a comment explaining it. YAML itself does not support comments directly, but this can be used for documentation purposes.
