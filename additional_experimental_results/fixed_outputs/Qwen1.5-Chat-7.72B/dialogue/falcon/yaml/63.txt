```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: dialogue_order
    speaker: speaker_name
    text: dialogue_narration

# Fixed YAML Data
```
The original YAML code block was missing the 'dialogues' key under 'game', which has been corrected with a list of dialogue. The `text` field is now "dialogue_narration" to provide a new value if needed. The rest of the template remains unchanged.
