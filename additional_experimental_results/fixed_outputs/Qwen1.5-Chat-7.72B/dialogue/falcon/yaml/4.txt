```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: "dialogue order"
    speaker:
      - name: "speaker name"
    text: "dialogue or narration"
```
The YAML code block has been corrected by adding quotation marks around the keys that contain spaces or special characters, and reformatting the `speaker` key to list multiple values separated by `-`.
