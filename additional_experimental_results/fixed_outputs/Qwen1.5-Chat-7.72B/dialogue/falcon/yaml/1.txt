Here is the corrected YAML code with new values provided for the `game` section and a properly formatted string for the in-game dialogue:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: 1
    speaker: Character Name
    text: "Welcome to the game. What would you like to do next?"
```

The in-game dialogue has been replaced with a multi-line string in Python syntax, which is properly formatted within triple quotes:

```python
return """
speaker:
    name: Character Name
    dialogue:
        - "Welcome to the game. What would you like to do next?"
"""
```
