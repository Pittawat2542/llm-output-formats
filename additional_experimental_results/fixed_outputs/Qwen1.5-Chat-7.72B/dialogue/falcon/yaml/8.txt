Here's the corrected YAML code with new values added for the `dialogues` list:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: 1
    speaker: Character A
    text: "Hello, how are you?"
  - order: 2
    speaker: Character B
    text: "I'm doing well, thanks. How about you?"
- message_text: "This is an example dialogue without a specific order"
```
