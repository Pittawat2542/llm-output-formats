```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: dialogue_order
     speaker: John
     text: Welcome to the game. Have a great time!
   - order: 2
     speaker: Jane
     text: That sounds nice. Have fun with that!
```
The original YAML code had a few issues. I removed the extra backticks, fixed the indentation for the `dialogues` key, and corrected the typo in "dialogue order" to "dialogue_order". The output is now properly formatted YAML.
