Here's the corrected YAML without any syntax errors. I've removed the `yaml` section since it's not necessary and provided new values for `player2`, `player3`, and the second dialogue.

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: 1
    speaker: Speaker 1
    text: Dialogue 1
  - order: 2
    speaker: Player 2
    text: "Player 2 dialogue"
    player2: 2

  # New dialogue for player3 with correct order and values
  - order: 3
    speaker: Player 3
    text: "Player 3 dialogue"
    player3: 3
```
