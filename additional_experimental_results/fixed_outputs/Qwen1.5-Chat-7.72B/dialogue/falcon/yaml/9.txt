```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: dialogue_order
    speaker: player1_name
    text: "Hi, I'm here to play"

- player2:
  - order: :01
    text: "Hey, I'm here too!"
```
Note: In the fixed YAML, I changed `speaker` value to `player1_name`, assuming a proper name is meant for player1. Also, I removed the extra backticks (``) from the text and adjusted the `order` key format to match the template. The second dialogue for player2 is presented correctly with no issues.
