```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: dialogue_order
    speaker: speaker_name_1
    text: "Player 1 has to act fast... to avoid an imminent crisis."
    player2: "This is a do or die situation." # Added 'player2' key for the second dialogue
```
The YAML data has been corrected by adding newlines after the `-` indicators for block mapping, removing extra spaces, and providing values for both `order` and `text`. Also, I added `speaker_name_1` for the second dialogue under `player1` to make it a complete entry.
