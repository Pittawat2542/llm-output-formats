```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: 1
    speaker: Sophia
    text: Hello, I am Sophia. Welcome to the library. Can I help you find a book?
   - order: 2
    speaker: Player
    text: Yes, I am looking for a book on the history of the city.
   - order: 3
    speaker: Sophia
    text: We have several books on that topic. Let me show you.
   - order: 4
    action: lead_to_history_books
    speaker: Sophia
    description: *Sophia walks the Player to a section of shelves containing books on the history of the city.*
   - order: 5
    speaker: Sophia
    text: These are some of the books we have on the history of the city.
   - order: 6
    speaker: Sophia
    text: Is there anything else I can help you with today?
   - order: 7
    speaker: Player
    text: No, that's all. Thank you.
   - order: 8
    speaker: Sophia
    text: Okay. Please let me know if you need anything else.

```
In the fixed YAML, I made the following changes:
1. Removed the asterisk (`*`) from the `text` field of the fifth dialogue item because it's not a valid alias in YAML. Instead, used an action called `lead_to_history_books` to indicate the walk to shelves.
2. Added a new value for `description`, which now includes the action and provides context for that part of the dialogue.
