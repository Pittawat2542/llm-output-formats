```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: 1
    speaker: Narrator
    text: Welcome to the land of Eldoria, a mystical realm of wonder and magic.
  - order: 2
    speaker: Eryndor Thorne
    text: I've been traveling these woods for hours. I hope I'm close to finding the ancient ruins.
  - order: 3
    speaker: Lila Moonwhisper
    text: Ah, a traveler! We don't often get strangers here. What brings you to our neck of the woods?
```
The YAML data is now corrected with proper indentation and removed the unnecessary single quotes around the strings. There were no syntax errors in the original message, so I've only formatted it for readability.
