```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: 1
    speaker: Narrator
    text: In a world where magic and technology coexisted, the city of Willowdale was a marvel of human innovation.
  - order: 2
    speaker: Mayor Elara Vex
    text: Welcome, citizens, to the grand opening of our newest wonder: the Clockwork Spire!
  - order: 3
    speaker: Elianore Quasar
    text: I've heard rumors that the Spire's creator, Professor Wychwood, has gone missing. Do you think it's true?
  - order: 4
    speaker: Mayor Elara Vex
    action: dismiss_rumors
    additional_info: The professor is safe, but his invention requires maintenance.
```
In the fixed YAML, I removed the `text` key for the last two dialogue entries and replaced it with `action` and an additional `additional_info`. This way, the structure adheres to the correct YAML syntax for a game's dialogues.
