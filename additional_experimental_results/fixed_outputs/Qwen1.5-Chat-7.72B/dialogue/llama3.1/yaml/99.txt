```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: 4
    speaker: Bob
    text: "That's very kind of you. Can I help you find anything?"
  - order: 5
    speaker: Alice
    text: "No, thank you. I'm just browsing for now."
```
The error was in the `order` value for dialogue number 4. It was not properly indented and ended with a scalar value instead of a block mapping key. I have corrected the indentation and removed the extra scalar value to fix the YAML syntax.
