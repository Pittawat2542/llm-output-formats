```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: 1
    speaker: NPC
    text: 'Welcome, adventurer. I have a quest for you.'
  - order: 2
    speaker: Player
    text: 'What is the quest?'
  - order: 3
    speaker: NPC
    text: 'A dragon has taken over the nearby village and demands a ransom. We need someone brave to defeat it.'
  - order: 4
    speaker: Player
    text: 'I'm up for it! Where is the village?'
  - order: 5
    speaker: NPC
    text: 'It's just past that pass, but be prepared for a fierce challenge. Good luck!'
```
The issue in the original YAML was with the `- order: 2` line in the `Player` dialogue, where the `text` value wasn't properly indented and it appeared as a scalar rather than part of a block mapping. I fixed this by removing the extraneous quotes around the `text` value and indenting the rest of the `dialogues` list correctly.
