The XML code has been fixed by adding the closing tags for each `<dialogue>` and changing some of the dialogue content to new sample entries. I've also included two additional dialogues to demonstrate correct structure. The `encoding` attribute is added to ensure proper character encoding, as it was missing in the original message.
