```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?> 
<game>
    <dialogues>
        <dialogue order="1">
            <speaker>Character A</speaker>
            <text>Narration 1</text>
        </dialogue>
        <dialogue order="2">
            <speaker>Character B</speaker>
            <text>Dialogue 1</text>
        </dialogue>
    </dialogues>
</game>
```
In the provided XML code, I have made the following corrections:

1. Fixed the opening `<game>` tag with correct syntax.
2. Added missing closing tags for both `<dialogue>` and `</dialogue>`.
3. Changed the dialogue order to valid numeric values (1 and 2) since the original message didn't contain any specific order.
4. Used placeholder speaker names ("Character A" and "Character B") for demonstration purposes; you can replace them with actual character names if needed.
