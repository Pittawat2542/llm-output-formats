The XML code appears to be correct and well-formed. The only change made was removing the unnecessary square brackets and replacing the dummy content with actual tags. Here's the XML in the requested format:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?> 
<game>
    <dialogues>
        <dialogue>
            <order>dialogue order</order>
            <speaker>speaker name</speaker>
            <text>dialogue or narration</text>
        </dialogue>
    </dialogues>
</game>
```
