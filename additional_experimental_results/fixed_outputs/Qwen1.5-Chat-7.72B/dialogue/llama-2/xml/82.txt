The XML code provided appears to be correct. There are no syntax errors, and all the required elements (`<game>`, `<dialogues>`, `<dialogue>`, `<order>`, `<speaker>`, and `<text>`) are correctly formatted. Since there's nothing wrong with the XML, here's the corrected version in a code block:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?> 
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>dialogue order</order>
			<speaker>speaker name</speaker>
			<text>dialogue or narration</text>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```
