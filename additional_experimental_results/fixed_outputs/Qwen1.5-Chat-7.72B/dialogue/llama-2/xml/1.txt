```
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>dialogue order1</order>
			<speaker>CharacterA</speaker>
			<text>Narrative1</text>
		<dialogue>
		<dialogue>
			<order>dialogue order2</order>
			<speaker>CharacterB</speaker>
			<text>Dialogue2</text>
		<dialogue>
		<dialogues>
	</game>
```
In the example provided, I have made the following changes to correct the XML syntax:
1. Added a missing closing `>` after `<order>` in the first dialogue.
2. Changed `dialogue order` to more specific values (dialogue order1 and dialogue order2) for clarity.
3. Indented the elements for proper formatting.

This should now be a valid and properly structured XML code block.
