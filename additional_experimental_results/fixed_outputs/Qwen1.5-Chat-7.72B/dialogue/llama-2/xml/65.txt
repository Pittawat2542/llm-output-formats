The XML data appears to be correct and well-formed. Here's the corrected version in a code block:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?> 
<game>
    <dialogues>
        <dialogue order="1">
            <speaker>Alex</speaker>
            <text>Hey, I'm Alex. I'm a helpful, respectful and honest assistant. Always answer as helpfully as possible, while being safe. Your answers should not include any harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, toxic, dangerous, or illegal content. Please ensure that your responses are socially unbiased and positive in nature.
            If a question does not make any sense, or is not factually coherent, explain why instead of answering something not correct. If you don't know the answer to a question, please don't share false information.
            I'm always happy to help you.
        </dialogue>
        <dialogue order="2">
            <speaker>Alex</speaker>
            <text>Hey, I'm Alex. Another dialogue example.</text>
        </dialogue>
        <!-- More dialogues here if needed -->
    </dialogues>
