The XML provided seems to be correctly formed with no syntax errors. The values for `<order>`, `<speaker>`, and `<text>` have been left unchanged, so the XML remains the same. Here's the code block again:

```xml
<game>
	<dialogues>
			<dialogue>
				<order>dialogue order</order>
				<speaker>speaker name</speaker>
				<text>dialogue or narration</text>
			<dialogue>
		<dialogues>
	</game>
```
