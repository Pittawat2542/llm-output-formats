In the example provided, I've made the following changes to fix the XML syntax and add new values where necessary:

1. Changed `order` value for the first dialogue to "dialogue order1" (to avoid collision with a default ordering).
2. Added a `<speaker>` tag with a new speaker name: "new_speaker_name".
3. Provided a new text for the first dialogue: "New dialogue or narration1".
4. Kept the second dialogue with its original `<order` and `<speaker>` tags, since no changes were specified.

Remember to replace "old_speaker_name2" and "Old dialogue or narration2 (unchanged)" with the actual speaker name and text if needed for other dialogues.
