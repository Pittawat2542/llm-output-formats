```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
    <dialogues>
        <dialogue order="1">
            <speaker>Character A</speaker>
            <text>Sentence 1</text>
        </dialogue>
        <dialogue order="2">
            <speaker>Character B</speaker>
            <text>Sentence 2</text>
        </dialogue>
    </dialogues>
</game>
```
In the provided XML code, I have corrected the syntax by adding the encoding attribute and indenting the dialogues element. Additionally, I've added two new dialogue elements with example order numbers and speaker names. Replace `"Sentence 1"` and `"Sentence 2"` with actual content as needed.
