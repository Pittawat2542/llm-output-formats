```
The XML code block has been corrected by adding the missing closing tags for the `<dialogue>` elements, specifying a unique `order` attribute for each dialogue, and providing new text values. The first dialogue now has an order of "1" and sample text "Narration 1", while the second dialogue has an order of "2" with "Dialogue 1".
