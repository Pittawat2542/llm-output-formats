Here's the YAML data fixed with correct syntax:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text: dialogue or narration
```
This is a single YAML block representing the game's dialogues, with each dialogue listed as a separate item under `dialogues`. The `-` sign before each key indicates that it's an array entry.
