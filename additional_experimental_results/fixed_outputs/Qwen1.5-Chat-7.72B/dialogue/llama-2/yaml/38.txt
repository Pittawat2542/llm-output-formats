```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: 1
     speaker: the player
     text: "You're in a room with doors to the west, east, north, and south."
   - order: 2
     speaker: NPC
     text: "Which door do you want to go through first?"
   - order: 3
     speaker: the player
     text: "I'll head west for now."
   - order: 4
     speaker: NPC
     text: "You find yourself at another room's entrance. Which way next?"

# Rest of the YAML data can be added here as needed
```
This example fixes the syntax issue by properly indenting and using quotation marks for strings, and it provides new values for `speaker` (NPC in this case) and some sample dialogue to demonstrate a functioning dialogue system. If there's no additional YAML data required, only this corrected block is returned.
