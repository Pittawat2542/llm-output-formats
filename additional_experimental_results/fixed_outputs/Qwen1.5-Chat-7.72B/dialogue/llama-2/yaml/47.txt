```
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: "dialogue_order_1"
     speaker: "SpeakerA"
     text: "Dialogue 1"
   - order: "dialogue_order_2"
     speaker: "SpeakerB"
     text: "Dialogue 2"
   # Add more entries as needed
```
This YAML code fixes the incorrect syntax by replacing spaces with hyphens in the `order` keys and using quotes for string values. It also adds two example dialogue entries, but you can remove or add more depending on your game's requirements.
