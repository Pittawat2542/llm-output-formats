The YAML data provided is correctly formatted. Here's the corrected YAML in a code block:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: dialogue_order
     speaker: speaker_name
     text: dialogue_or_narration
```

I've made sure that the backticks around "speaker name" and "dialogue or narration" are not needed since they don't contain special characters. The YAML is now ready for processing according to the given template.
