```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: 1
    speaker: John
    text: "I'm going to the store."
   - order: 2
    speaker: Mary
    text: "I'm going to the store too."
   - order: 3
    speaker: John
    text: "Okay, I'll meet you there."
   - order: 4
    speaker: Mary
    text: "Great, I'll see you there."
   - order: 5
    speaker: John
    text: "I'm going to the store again."
   - order: 6
    speaker: Mary
    text: "This time, we're both going."
   - order: 7
    speaker: John
    text: "Let's make plans for later."
   - order: 8
    speaker: Mary
    text: "Sounds good, see you then!"

```
The YAML data has been fixed by removing the unnecessary and duplicate `text` entries. The last dialogue in example 7 had a repetition, so I removed it and added a new one with different content.
