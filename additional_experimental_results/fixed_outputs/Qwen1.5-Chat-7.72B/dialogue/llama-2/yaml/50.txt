Here's the corrected YAML data with the syntax fixed and new values added if necessary. There was no issue with the original message; I've simply reformatted it according to YAML conventions:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: "Dialogue Order 1"
    speaker: "Character Name 1"
    text: "This is a sample dialogue or narration."

# If you need more entries, repeat this pattern
```

Output in YAML format:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: Dialogue Order 1
    speaker: Character Name 1
    text: This is a sample dialogue or narration.
```
