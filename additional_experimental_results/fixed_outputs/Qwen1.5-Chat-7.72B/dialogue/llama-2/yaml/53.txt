Here's the corrected YAML code block:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: dialogue_order
    speaker: speaker_name
    text: dialogue_or_narration
```

I removed the unnecessary backticks and added a new example for `order` with a default value. You can customize this according to your specific game data.
