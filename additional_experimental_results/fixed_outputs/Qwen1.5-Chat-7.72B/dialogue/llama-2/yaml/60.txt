Here's the corrected YAML with proper indentation and no errors:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: dialogue_order
    speaker: speaker_name
    text: dialogue_or_narration
```

This YAML defines a single item in the `dialogues` list, with the specified keys for order, speaker name, and text. The backticks around `/INST` have been removed as they don't seem to be part of the data.
