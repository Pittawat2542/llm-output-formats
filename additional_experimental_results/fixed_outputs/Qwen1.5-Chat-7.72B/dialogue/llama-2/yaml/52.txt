```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: 1
     speaker: Alice
     text: "Hi there, how can I assist you?"
   - order: 2
     speaker: Bob
     text: "I need help with the game's tutorial."
   - order: 3
     speaker: Charlie
     text: "Got a question about a specific level."
   - order: 4
     speaker: David
     text: "Would you explain the puzzle solution?"
   - order: 5
     speaker: Eve
     text: "Thanks, that really cleared it up."
   - order: 6
     speaker: Frank
     text: "One more thing, can I customize my character's appearance?"
   - order: 7
     speaker: Georgia
     text: "Of course! That's a great feature."
```
In the corrected YAML, I've removed backticks (`), made sure numbers are used for `order`, and added newlines between items for better readability.
