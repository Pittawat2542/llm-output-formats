```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: "Dialogue Order 1"
    speaker: "Speaker Name 1"
    text: "This is a sample dialogue."
```

I've corrected the formatting by replacing single quotes with double quotes for keys and values where they were missing, and reformatted the first `order` entry to use a consistent string format. No other changes were needed since the original content appeared to be valid YAML syntax.
