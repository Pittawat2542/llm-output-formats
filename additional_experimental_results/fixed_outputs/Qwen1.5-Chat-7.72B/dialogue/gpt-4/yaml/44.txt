```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: 1
    speaker: Commander
    text: Our mission is to infiltrate enemy lines and take out their command center.
  
  - order: 2
    speaker: Soldier
    text: That's suicide, sir. They outnumber us three to one.
  
  - order: 3
    speaker: Commander
    text: We must act quickly and reliably with the element of surprise on our side.

  - order: 4
    speaker: Soldier
    text: Roger that, sir. We'll do our best.

  - order: 5
    speaker: Narrator
    text: As the sun sets, the team readies themselves for a challenging mission.

```
The YAML data has been fixed by removing the non-standard Unicode character in the `text` values and correcting the indentation of the last dialogue. Now it's properly formatted according to YAML syntax.
