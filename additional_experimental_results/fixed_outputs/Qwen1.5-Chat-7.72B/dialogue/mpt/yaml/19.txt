```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: 1
    speaker: player
    text: "Hey there, how are you?"
  - order: 2
    speaker: NPC
    text: "I'm very well, it's a pleasure to meet you."
```
The YAML code block is now correct. There were no syntax errors; I just rearranged the `-` delimiter to remove the extra line for `speaker`.
