```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: 1
    speaker: speaker01
    text: "Hello Player! I'm your guide!"
  - order: 2
    speaker: speaker01
    text: "The world is full of danger, you have to be strong."
  - order: 3
    speaker: speaker01
    text: "Don't waste your time on things that don't matter."
  - order: 4
    speaker: speaker02
    text: "We don't have that."
  - order: 5
    speaker: speaker01
    text: "That doesn't matter."
  - order: 6
    speaker: speaker01
    text: "Always be strong"
    # Removed the incorrect scalar and added a new dialogue

```
The corrected YAML code block for your game dialogues is provided above. I removed the extra scalar for the last dialogue, and added a new dialogue with `order` 6.
