Here's the corrected YAML with proper syntax and updated values where needed:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: " Enemy Description "
    id: "EnemyID"
    name: "EnemyName"
    stats:
      - key: atk
        value: 100
      - key: def
        value: 50
      - key: hp
        value: 300
      - key: mp
        value: 100
      - key: spd
        value: 80

```
The changes made include:

1. Corrected the quotes in `description`, `id`, and `name` to properly define string values.
2. Added indentation to make the YAML syntax clearer.
3. Replaced the `stats:` with a list of key-value pairs using `-` as the delimiter for better readability and YAML structure.

No errors were present in the original message, so this is the correct output.
