The YAML data provided seems to be correct, and there are no syntax errors. Here's the code block with the fixed YAML in Markdown format:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "description"
    id: "id"
    name: "name"
    stats:
      atk: 10
      def: 10
      hp: 10
      mp: 10
      spd: 10
```
This YAML definition has been corrected, and all values are integers as specified in the original message.
