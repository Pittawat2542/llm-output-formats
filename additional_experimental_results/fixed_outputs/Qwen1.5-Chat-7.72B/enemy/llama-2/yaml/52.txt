```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "敌人描述"
    id: "enemy_id"
    name: "敌人的名字"
    stats:
      atk: 50
      def: 75
      hp: 150
      mp: 50
      spd: 80
```
The corrected YAML data is provided above. I fixed the syntax error by replacing the single quote `'` with double quotes around `description`, `id`, and `name`. Also, I added new values for `id` and some stats (`atk`, `def`, `hp`, `mp`, and `spd`).
