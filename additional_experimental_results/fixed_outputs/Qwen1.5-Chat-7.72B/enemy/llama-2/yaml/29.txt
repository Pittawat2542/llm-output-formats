```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "A description of the enemy"
    id: 654321
    name: EnemyStats
    stats:
      atk: 150
      def: 120
      hp: 200
      mp: 80
      spd: 120
```
The YAML data is now corrected. I've replaced the missing quotes around the `description` and updated the `id` value to a random integer (654321). The rest of the data seems fine, so no changes were needed.
