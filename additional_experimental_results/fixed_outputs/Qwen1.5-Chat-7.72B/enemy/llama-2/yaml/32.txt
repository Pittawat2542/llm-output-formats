The original YAML data seems to be correct. Here's the code block representation without any changes, as it is already in the correct format:

```yaml
game:
  battle:
    enemy:
      description: "This is a description"
      id: "enemy_id"
      name: "enemy_name"
      stats:
        atk: 10
        def: 10
        hp: 10
        mp: 10
        spd: 10
```
