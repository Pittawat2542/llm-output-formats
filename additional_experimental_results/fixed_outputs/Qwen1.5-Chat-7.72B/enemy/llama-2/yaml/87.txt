The YAML syntax in the provided message is correct. Here's the corrected YAML in a code block:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "description"
    id: "id"
    name: "name"
    stats:
      atk: 50  # int value, I added the numbers
      def: 30
      hp: 100
      mp: 20
      spd: 40
```
The template was fine; there were no issues in it. I just added the missing integer values for `atk`, `def`, `hp`, and `mp`.
