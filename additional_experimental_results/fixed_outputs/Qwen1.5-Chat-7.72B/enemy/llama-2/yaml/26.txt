Here is the corrected YAML data:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "Description"
    id: 12345
    name: "Player"
    stats:
      atk: 50
      def: 75
      hp: 200
      mp: 50
      spd: 80
```

In the original message, there were no syntax errors. I have maintained the same structure and values for the example. If you need to change any of the values, simply update them in the YAML accordingly.
