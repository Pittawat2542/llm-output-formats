```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "I am a cute little corgi"
    id: 1
    name: "Corgi"
    stats:
      atk: 20
      def: 20
      hp: 20
      mp: 20
      spd: 20
```
The YAML in the Markdown code block is now correct. There were no syntax errors, so I've only provided the corrected YAML without additional changes.
