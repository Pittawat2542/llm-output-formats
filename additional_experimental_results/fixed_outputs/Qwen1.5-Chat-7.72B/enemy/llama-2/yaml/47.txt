```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "enemy description"
    id: "敌人id"
    name: "enemy name"
    stats:
      atk: 20
      def: 15
      hp: 150
      mp: 30
      spd: 25
```
The YAML data has been corrected. I removed the invalid single quote around the keys and provided new values for `description`, `id`, `name`, and updated the stats to example values. The final YAML is now as shown in the code block.
