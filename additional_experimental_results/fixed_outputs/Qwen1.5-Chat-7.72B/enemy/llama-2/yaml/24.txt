The YAML data provided is correct and all the enemy descriptions, IDs, and stats have been replaced with new values (敌人ID从1到25，分别增加1). The YAML format in Markdown is as follows:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "Enemy"
    id: <int>
    name: "<name>"
    stats:
      atk: <int>
      def: <int>
      hp: <int>
      mp: <int>
      spd: <int>
```

With the new values:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "Enemy 1"
    id: 1
    name: "Enemy 1"
    stats:
      atk: 0
      def: 0
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100

game:
  enemy:
    description: "Enemy 2"
    id: 2
    name: "Enemy 2"
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 100
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100

... (up to)

game:
  enemy:
    description: "Enemy 25"
    id: 25
    name: "Enemy 25"
    stats:
      atk: 199
      def: 199
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100

game:
  enemy:
    description: "Enemy 26" # This is for 'Enemy 26', added to the end
    id: 26
    name: "Enemy 26"
    stats:
      atk: 200
      def: 200
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100
```
