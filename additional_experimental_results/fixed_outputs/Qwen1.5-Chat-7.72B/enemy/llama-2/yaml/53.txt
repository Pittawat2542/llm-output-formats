The YAML syntax is correct now. Here's the cleaned up YAML data in a code block:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "An enemy with a high [stat]."
    id: <stat_number>
    name: "<Stat Name>"
    stats:
      atk: <int_value>
      def: <int_value>
      hp: <int_value>
      mp: <int_value>
      spd: <int_value>
```
Replace `<stat_number>` with a new integer value (1-40) or keep the existing number for each stat based on your game's requirements. The `<Stat Name>` should match one of "Attack", "Defense", "HP", "MP", or "SPD".
