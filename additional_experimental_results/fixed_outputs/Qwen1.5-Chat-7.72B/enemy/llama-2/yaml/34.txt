Here is the corrected YAML data with new values for `description`, `name`, and `stats`:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "A powerful敌军"
    id: "Powerful-enemy-1"
    name: "Elemental Overlord"
    stats:
      atk: 200
      def: 150
      hp: 1500
      mp: 500
      spd: 120
```
In this example, I've changed the `description`, `id`, and `name` fields to provide more specific information. The `stats` have also been updated with different values for demonstration purposes.
