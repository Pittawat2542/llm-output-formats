Here's the corrected YAML code without any errors:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: atk_int_value
      def: def_int_value
      hp: hp_int_value
      mp: mp_int_value
      spd: spd_int_value
```
I've removed the backticks around the variable names and made sure they follow the correct naming convention for YAML keys (all lowercase with underscores). The value types have also been specified after the keys.
