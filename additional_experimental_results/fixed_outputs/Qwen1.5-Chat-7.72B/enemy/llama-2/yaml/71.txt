The YAML syntax in the provided message is actually correct. It's just a code block with single quotes for strings, which is fine in YAML. No changes are needed. Here's the corrected YAML in a code block:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "enemy description"
    id: "enemy id"
    name: "enemy name"
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 50
      hp: 50
      mp: 50
      spd: 50
```
