```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "This is a description"
    id: 1
    name: "Enemy Name"
    stats:
      atk: 150
      def: 200
      hp: 500
      mp: 200
      spd: 120
```
The YAML data in the provided example was missing values and had incorrect formatting. I have fixed it by specifying `atk`, `def`, `hp`, `mp`, and `spd` with their respective integer values. Now it's correct and ready to be used.
