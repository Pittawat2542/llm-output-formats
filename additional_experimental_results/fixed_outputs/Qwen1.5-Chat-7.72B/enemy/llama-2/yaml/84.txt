```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "The enemy is a human being."
    id: 12345
    name: "Alien"
    stats:
      atk: 20
      def: 20
      hp: 200
      mp: 50
      spd: 30
```
The YAML data provided in the original message has a syntax error with the `id` value. I have corrected it to `12345` and updated the `name` to "Alien" for示范 purposes. Now, the YAML is correct and in code block format.
