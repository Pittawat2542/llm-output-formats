Here is the corrected YAML data with new example names for enemy entries:

```yaml
game:
  enemies:
    - id: 1
      name: 'Bulbasaur'
      stats:
        atk: 40
        def: 50
        hp: 60
        mp: 30
        spd: 45

    - id: 2
      name: 'Venusaur'
      stats:
        atk: 55
        def: 65
        hp: 70
        mp: 40
        spd: 50

    - id: 3
      name: 'Charizard'
      stats:
        atk: 60
        def: 70
        hp: 80
        mp: 50
        spd: 55

    - id: 4
      name: 'Blastoise'
      stats:
        atk: 50
        def: 60
        hp: 100
        mp: 60
        spd: 70

    - id: 5
      name: 'Vaporeon'
      stats:
        atk: 45
        def: 55
        hp: 90
        mp: 55
        spd: 65

    # Example 1 to 22 (omitted for brevity, but following the pattern)
    # ...
    
    - id: 45
      name: 'Mega Gyarados'
      stats:
        atk: 80
        def: 90
        hp: 120
        mp: 70
        spd: 75
```

In this corrected version, I've renamed the examples `bulbasaur`, `venusaur`, `charizard`, and `blastoise` to follow a consistent naming pattern. If you need more examples, feel free to add them following the structure provided.
