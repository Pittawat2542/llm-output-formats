The YAML data provided is correct. It's a valid representation of a game entity with an enemy section. Here's the corrected YAML in a code block:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "This is the description of the enemy"
    id: "enemyId"
    name: "Enemy Name"
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 50
      hp: 100
      mp: 50
      spd: 20
```
