```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "A敌人的描述"
    id: "enemy_id"
    name: "敌人名称"
    stats:
      atk: 250
      def: 125
      hp: 120
      mp: 120
      spd: 110
```
The original YAML code had incorrect syntax with single quotes instead of double quotes for the string values, and missing values for `id` and some stats. I've fixed those issues by replacing single quotes with double quotes, providing new values, and ensuring all keys are correctly spelled. The updated YAML is presented in a code block as requested.
