```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
    <enemy>
        <id>2</id>
        <name>Asmodeus</name>
        <description>The Adversary of God</description>
        <stats>
            <hp>300</hp>
            <mp>150</mp>
            <atk>150</atk>
            <def>120</def>
            <spd>110</spd>
        </stats>
    </enemy>
</game>
```
In this example, the issue was with incorrect closing tags for the `<stats>` and `</enemy>` elements. I have corrected them by adding a forward slash (`/`) after each tag, and also updated the `id` value to `2` (since it's not specified in the original data). The XML now follows the correct syntax and structure.
