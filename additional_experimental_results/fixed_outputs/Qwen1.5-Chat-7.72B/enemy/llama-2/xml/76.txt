        <id>ENEMY1</id>
        <name>RedGoblin</name>
        <description>A fierce creature with sharp claws and fiery breath.</description>

In the fixed XML, I've changed the `id` attribute value to "ENEMY1" (since it's not specified as a correct integer), updated the `<name>` element with a new name, and left the rest of the attributes unchanged. The `<(stats>)` tag was missing a closing `</stats>`, which has been corrected.
