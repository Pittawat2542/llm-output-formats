The XML code provided has a missing closing tag for the `<stats>` element. I have corrected that issue and added new values for `hp`, `mp`, `atk`, `def`, and `spd` since they were not specified. Here's the updated XML with correct syntax:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?> 
<game>
	<enemy>
		<id>id</id>
		<name>name</name>
		<description>description</description>
		<stats>
			<hp>100</hp>
			<mp>50</mp>
			<atk>50</atk>
			<def>30</def>
			<spd>40</spd>
		</stats>
	</enemy>
</game>
```
