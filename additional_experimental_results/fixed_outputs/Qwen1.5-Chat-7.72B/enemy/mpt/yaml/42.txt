```
game:
  enemy:
    description: "description"
    id: "id"
    name: "name"
    stats:
      atk: 50 # int value, updated to a valid number
      def: 30
      hp: 100
      mp: 20
      spd: 40
```
The original YAML was missing quotation marks for the `description`, `id`, and `name` keys. I have added them and also provided numerical values for the stats, ensuring correct syntax.
