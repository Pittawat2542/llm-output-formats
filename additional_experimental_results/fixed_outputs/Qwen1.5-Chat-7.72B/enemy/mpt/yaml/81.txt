The YAML data provided is already correctly formatted. Here's the corrected code block in YAML format, with inline formatting for readability:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: 1
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: 1
      def: 1
      hp: 1
      mp: 1
      spd: 1
```

This YAML code represents a `game` object with an `enemy` property containing descriptive and statistical information for the enemy. The syntax is correct, and no changes were needed.
