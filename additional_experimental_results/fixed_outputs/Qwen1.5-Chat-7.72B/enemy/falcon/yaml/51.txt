Here is the corrected YAML data with proper syntax and new values for `stats.atk`, `stats.def`, and `hp`:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: 100   # Added a value for 'atk'
      def: 50    # Added a value for 'def'
      hp: 300   # Added a value for 'hp'
      mp: 100   # Existing 'mp' value remains the same
      spd: 80    # Existing 'spd' value remains the same
```
The YAML is now correctly formatted and all missing values have been added.
