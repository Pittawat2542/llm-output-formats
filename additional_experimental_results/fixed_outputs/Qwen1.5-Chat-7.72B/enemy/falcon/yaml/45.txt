Here is the corrected YAML data:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description:敌人的描述
    id: enemy_id_value
    name: enemy_name_value
    stats:
      atk: 50
      def: 20
      hp: 1000
      mp: 500
      spd: 60
      stats_set:
        - type: spell_set
          list:
            - spell1
            - spell2
            - spell3
        - mana: 8000

```
I've made the following changes:

1. Removed extraneous backticks and spaces around values.
2. Changed `id` to a more descriptive `enemy_id_value` (assuming it's an actual value).
3. Altered `def` to a consistent format with other stats.
4. Corrected `hp`, `mp`, and `spd` values.
5. Added new lines for readability and fixed the `stats_set` structure by including type first and then list.
