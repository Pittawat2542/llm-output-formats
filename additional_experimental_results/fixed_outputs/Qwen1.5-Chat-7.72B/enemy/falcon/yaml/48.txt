Here is the corrected YAML data with new values for the `player` and `enemy.stats` sections:

```yaml
game:
  player:
    description: The main character
    id: PlayerID
    name: PlayerName
    stats:
      atk: 10
      def: 8
      hp: 35
      mp: 12
      spd: 9

  enemy:
    - description: Enemy Type 1
      id: EnemyType1
      name: Enemy1
      stats:
        atk: 4
        def: 6
        hp: 20
        mp: 5
        spd: 3
    
    - description: Enemy Type 2
      id: EnemyType2
      name: Enemy2
      stats:
        atk: 6
        def: 4
        hp: 30
        mp: 8
        spd: 5
```
In the corrected YAML, I added `description`, `id`, and `name` properties to the `player` section, and created two `enemy` entries with their respective stats. The syntax is now correct according to YAML standards.
