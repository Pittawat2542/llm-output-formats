Here's the corrected YAML data with proper syntax and new values if needed:

```yaml
game:
  enemies:
    - name: Infiltrator
      health_points: 20
    - name: Enforcer
      health_points: 7
    - name: Sentinel
      health_points: 5

# Markdown code block
```

The error was caused by missing the start of a document, so I added ````yaml` and ````` to enclose the corrected YAML. I've also reformatted it into a list for the enemies with each enemy having its own key-value pair for name and health_points. If there were no issues in the original message, this is how it should look now.
