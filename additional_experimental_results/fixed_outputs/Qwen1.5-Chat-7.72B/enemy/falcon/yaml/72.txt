```yaml
game:
  player:
    id: player-id
    description: Player's Description
    name: player-name
    stats:
      strength: "Strength Integer Value"
      hit_crit: "Hit/Crit String Value"
      dodge: "Dodge String Value"
  enemy:
    - name: Enemy1
      description: Enemy1 Description
      id: enemy1-id
      stats:
        attack: atk-int-value
        defense: def-int-value
        health: hp-int-value
        magic: mp-int-value
        speed: spd-int-value
```
Here's the corrected YAML code with the necessary syntax changes and new values provided for the player section. The enemy section now has separate entries for name, description, and stats.
