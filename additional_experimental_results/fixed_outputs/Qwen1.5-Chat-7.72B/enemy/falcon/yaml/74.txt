```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "Description of the enemy"
    id: "enemy_id123"
    name: " EnemyName1"
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 50
      hp: 300
      mp: 0
      spd: 80
```
The corrected YAML data is provided above. The root of the `game` object should be a dictionary, and I've updated the values for `description`, `id`, and `stats`. Now it's in proper YAML format with all keys completed.
