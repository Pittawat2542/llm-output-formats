The original YAML code has some syntax errors and missing values. I've fixed the issues and provided new values for the `enemy` section. Here's the corrected YAML in a code block:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: A small, pesky creature with a fondness for trouble.
    id: E001
    name: Goblin
    stats:
      atk: 25
      def: 12
      hp: 45
      mp: 7
      spd: 22
```
Now the YAML is correct and complete. You can copy this code into a Markdown block as needed.
