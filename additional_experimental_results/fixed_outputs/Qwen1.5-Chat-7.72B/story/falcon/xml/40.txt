```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
    <title>My Game Title</title>
    <synopsis>A captivating game story synopsis goes here...</synopsis>
    <beginning>Start of the exciting adventure...</beginning>
    <ending>Final moments of triumph and closure...</ending>
</game>
```
In the provided code block, I've made the following corrections:

1. Added `encoding="UTF-8"` to the `<xml>` declaration for proper character encoding.
2. Replaced `"Title of the Game"` with a custom value `"My Game Title"` for the `<title>`.
3. Created new values for `<synopsis>` and `<beginning>`/`<ending>` with descriptive content.
4. The XML structure is now well-formed and error-free.

Note: If you don't want to use custom values, simply delete the comments and keep the existing ones.
