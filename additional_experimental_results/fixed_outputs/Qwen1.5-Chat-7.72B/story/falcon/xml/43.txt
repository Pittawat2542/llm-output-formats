```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
    <title>Game Title</title>
    <synopsis>Game Story Synopsis</synopsis>
    <beginning>The Beginning of the Game</beginning>
    <ending>The Ending of the Game</ending>
</game>
```
In the fixed XML, I've corrected the `game` element by adding its content and changed the title to "Game Title". The other elements are also filled in with appropriate values. Since there were no syntax errors or missing keys, only the corrected XML is returned.
