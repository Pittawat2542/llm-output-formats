Here's the corrected YAML data with proper syntax and new values where needed:

```yaml
game:
  title: The Adventures of the Resurrected Hero
  cast:
    - role: Primary Protagonist
      gender: Male
      character: Arden Ironheart
    synopsis: In a world on the brink of destruction, the once-fallen hero rises to vanquish evil and restore peace.
```

Output in YAML format:

```yaml
game:
  title: The Adventures of the Resurrected Hero
  cast:
    - role: Primary Protagonist
      gender: Male
      character: Arden Ironheart
    synopsis: In a world on the brink of destruction, the once-fallen hero rises to vanquish evil and restore peace.
