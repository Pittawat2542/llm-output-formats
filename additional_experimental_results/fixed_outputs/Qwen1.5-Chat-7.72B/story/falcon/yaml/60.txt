```yaml
game:
  title: Game Title Redux
  beginning: The Adventure Awaits
  ending: Journey's End
  synopsis: "Two players embark on a quest to discover hidden treasures"
  difficulty: Medium

```
The corrected YAML data includes the 'game' key and adds new values for the beginning, ending, synopsis, and difficulty. Now it should be valid according to the provided template.
