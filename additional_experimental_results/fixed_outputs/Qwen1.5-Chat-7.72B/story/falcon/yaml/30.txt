Here's the corrected YAML data with proper syntax and new values if needed:

```yaml
game:
  title: "Surviving Wasteland"
  beginning: "The game begins in a devastated world"
  ending: "Your ultimate goal is to rebuild and find hope"
  synopsis: |
    You are a survivor navigating a harsh, unforgiving landscape where survival is the name of the game. Discover treacherous landscapes, forge alliances, and make tough decisions as you scavenge for resources and fend off threats. The story takes you on an epic journey of resilience and triumph amidst adversity.
```

The changes made include:
1. Renaming "synopsis" to a multi-line value with the `|` notation for readability.
2. Providing new values for "beginning" and "ending."
3. Reformatting the title to match the expected YAML format.
