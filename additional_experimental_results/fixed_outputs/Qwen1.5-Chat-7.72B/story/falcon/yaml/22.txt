Here's the corrected YAML code with proper syntax and new values where needed:

```yaml
game:
  - title: Game Title
    description: A brief description of the game.
    synopsis: game story synopsis
  starting_point: the beginning of the game
  ending_note: the ending of the game

```
In this fixed YAML, I removed the unnecessary asterisks and combined the "name" field with the first item in the `synopsis` list. The other items were restructured as a list under the "game" key.
