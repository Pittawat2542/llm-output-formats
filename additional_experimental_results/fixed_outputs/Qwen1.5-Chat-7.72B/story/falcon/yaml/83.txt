Here is the corrected YAML data with new values if needed:

```yaml
game:
  beginning:
    description: "Introduces players to the game world and necessary setup"
    start_time: "9 AM"

  ending:
    description: "The climactic finale and outcomes for the hero"
    conclusion_message: "Goodbye, and thanks for playing!"
    points_awarded: 100

  synopsis:
    brief_summary: "A thrilling adventure with unexpected twists"

  title: "Epic Quest"

```
In this YAML code block, I've fixed the syntax errors by adding missing colons, separating keys into separate lines, and provided new values for `start_time` in the `beginning` section, a `conclusion_message` in the `ending` section, and updated the `synopsis` brief summary.
