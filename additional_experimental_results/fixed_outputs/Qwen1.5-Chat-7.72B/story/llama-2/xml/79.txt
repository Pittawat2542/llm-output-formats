The provided XML code is already correct. It has proper syntax and all necessary elements for a game description (`title`, `synopsis`, `beginning`, and `ending`). Here's the XML in a code block without any changes:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>  
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>the ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```
