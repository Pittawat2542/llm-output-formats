    <title>The Tale of the Three Brothers</title>
    <synopsis>
        <paragraph>Once upon a time, there were three brothers who lived in a small village. They were all impoverished and decided to venture into the forest to hunt for survival.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>After their successful hunts, they sold the deer, bear, and wolf to earn enough money to improve their lives. The next day, their wealth increased, and they led happy lives together.</paragraph>

    <ending>...</ending>
</game>

I removed the unnecessary content within the `<synopsis>` tags and provided new paragraph tags to make it valid XML. The `<beginning>` and `<ending>` elements are empty, so I left them unchanged for now since they seem to be referencing an earlier or later part of the game story, which is not included in this example.
