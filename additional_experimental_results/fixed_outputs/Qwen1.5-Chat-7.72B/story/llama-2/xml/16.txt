Here's the corrected XML data:

```xml
<game>
	<title>Game Title</title>
	<synopsis>Game Story Synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>The Beginning of the Game</beginning>
	<ending>The Ending of the Game</ending>
</game>
```
I've changed the title element to "Game Title" and fixed the capitalization. The rest of the XML structure seems to be correct.
