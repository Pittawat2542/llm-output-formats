Here's the corrected XML with new values for the title and synopsis, as requested:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
    <title>Sample Game Title</title>
    <synopsis>A thrilling adventure set in a fantasy world.</synopsis>
    <beginning>
        <image src="https://example.com/game-start.jpg" alt="Game Beginning Image"></image>
        <text>This is the start of the game where players embark on their journey.</text>
    </beginning>
    <ending>
        <image src="https://example.com/game-end.png" alt="Game Ending Image"></image>
        <text>A climactic battle leads to a heartwarming conclusion.</text>
    </ending>
</game>
```

The title and synopsis have been changed from "Title" and "Synopsis" to "Sample Game Title" and "A thrilling adventure set in a fantasy world." Also, I've added image tags with proper source URLs and alternative text for the beginning and ending sections.
