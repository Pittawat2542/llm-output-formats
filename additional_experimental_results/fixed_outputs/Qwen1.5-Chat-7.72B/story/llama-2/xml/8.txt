Here is the corrected XML data with proper syntax and updated values if necessary. Since there's nothing wrong with the original XML structure, I'll only return it in a code block:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>Corrected Game Title</title>
	<synopsis>A New Game Story Synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>The Adventure Begins</beginning>
	<ending>The Epic Conclusion</ending>
</game>
```
