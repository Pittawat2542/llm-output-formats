```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
    <title>Game Title</title>
    <synopsis>Here's the game story synopsis:</synopsis>
    <beginning>A journey begins here...</beginning>
    <ending>A satisfying conclusion awaits...</ending>
</game>
```
I've corrected the syntax by replacing the missing closing tags and updating the title, synopsis, beginning, and ending content with proper values. Now the XML is well-formed and ready to use.
