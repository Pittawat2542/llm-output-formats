I have corrected the syntax issues, added values to the game title (`Horror Game: The Enigma`), and reformatted the XML structure. I have also separated the original questions into a `<questions>` section with each question having an `id`, `text`, type (multiple_choice), and its own set of answers. If there are more extra questions, you can add them in this same format within the `<questions>` section.
