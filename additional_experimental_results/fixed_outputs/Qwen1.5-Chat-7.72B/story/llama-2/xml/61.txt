```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
    <title>Game Title</title>
    <synopsis>A thrilling adventure</synopsis>
    <beginning>The players enter the world...</beginning>
    <ending>A climactic conclusion awaits...</ending>
</game>
```
I have corrected the XML syntax by adding the opening and closing tags correctly, replacing empty content with a valid synopsis, and ensuring proper indentation. The XML now looks good and is ready for use.
