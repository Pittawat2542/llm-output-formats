```yaml
game:
  beginning: The starting moment in the adventure
  ending: The climactic conclusion
  synopsis: A thrilling narrative that follows characters through trials and adventures
  title: Epic Game Adventure
```

The YAML data provided had a single backtick (`) at the beginning of the `synopsis` field, which caused the error. I have removed the extra backtick and updated the text for better readability.
