```yaml
game:
  beginning: The beginning of the game
  ending: The ending of the game
  synopsis: A captivating game story synopsis
  title: Game Title
```
### Explanation:

1. Fixed the double quotes around `beginning`, `ending`, `synopsis`, and `title` keys to properly start and end YAML strings.
2. Changed `beginning: the beginning of the game` to `beginning: The beginning of the game` for better readability and proper capitalization of the title. Similar changes were made for `ending`, `synopsis`, and `title`.
