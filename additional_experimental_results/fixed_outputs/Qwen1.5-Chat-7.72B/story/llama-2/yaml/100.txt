```yaml
game:
  beginning: "The player embarks on a quest"
  ending: "A climactic battle and resolution"
  synopsis: "A tale of adventure, friendship, and overcoming challenges"
  title: "Quest of the Unknown"
```

Here's the corrected YAML with new values for `beginning`, `ending`, and `synopsis`. The rest of the data seems to be in order.
