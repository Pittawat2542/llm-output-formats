Here is the YAML code block with corrected syntax and new values if needed:

```yaml
game:
  beginning: The adventure begins here.
  ending: A journey comes to an end.
  synopsis: A tale of courage and discovery.
  title: Epic Odyssey
```

Please note that I've changed "beginning" and "ending" to provide more descriptive titles, as the original ones were just placeholders. You can adjust them according to your specific game content.
