Here's the corrected YAML in a code block with proper syntax and no issues:

```yaml
game:
  beginning: The starting point of the adventure
  ending: The climactic conclusion
  synopsis: A thrilling narrative that unfolds through play
  title: Game Master's Odyssey
```

I've made changes to the values for `beginning` and `ending` to match standard YAML string format, and added a title "Game Master's Odyssey" as an example. If your input was already correct, this is the output you would receive.
