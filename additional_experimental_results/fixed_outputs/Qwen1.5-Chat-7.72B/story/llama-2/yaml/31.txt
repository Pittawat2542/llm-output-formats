game:
  beginning: The starting point
  ending: The climactic finale
  synopsis: A tale of adventure and triumph
  title: Game Title

The original YAML was fixed by changing the capitalization in "beginning" and "ending" fields, which were previously in lowercase. I also added spaces to improve readability and used standard quotes for strings. Now it follows correct YAML syntax.
