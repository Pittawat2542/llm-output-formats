```yaml
game:
  beginning: The Beginning of the Game
  ending: The Ending of the Game
  synopsis: "In a world filled with adventure, players embark on a journey to save the kingdom. Discover rich storyline and epic battles in 'Game Title'."
  title: Game Title
```
The YAML data has been corrected. The `synopsis` field now follows the correct format and title case rules, and the synopsis is limited to 100 words. The titles for both `beginning` and `title` are also in Title Case.
