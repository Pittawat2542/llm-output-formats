```yaml
game:
  title: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
  start: Link's awakening and journey to restore Hyrule
  end: Defeating Calamity Ganon, restoring peace, and discovering his heritage
  synopsis: An open-world action-adventure where Link explores a ruined Hyrule, gathers relics, and battles forces to save the kingdom

```
The YAML data has been corrected by reformatting the "ending" section as "end" since "beginning" is used consistently. I also added new values for the "start" and "synopsis" keys to provide a more complete game description. The output is now in the correct YAML format.
