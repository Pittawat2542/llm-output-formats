Here's the corrected YAML data:

```yaml
game:
  title: Adventure Game
  starting_point: The player embarks on their journey
  ending_note: A climactic conclusion awaits
  synopsis: "A tale of adventure and discovery unfolds"
  story:
    - episode1: Introduction to the World
    - episode2: Encountering the First Challenge
    - episode3: Climbing the Puzzle Mountain

game:
  title: AdventureGame
  starting_point: Start
  ending_note: Farewell
  synopsis: "An exciting odyssey through unknown lands"
```
The changes made include:

1. Renaming `ending` to `ending_note` since it doesn't contain a mapping value.
2. Adding new values for `starting_point`, `ending_note`, and `synopsis`.
3. Organizing the story into an array of episodes (using YAML lists).
