The YAML data has been corrected by adding missing values and restructuring the content. The title is now specified, the beginning and ending points have been simplified, and a synopsis has been created. Additionally, development details are added under 'development' section, and multiplayer details with their concept and invitation message under 'multiplayer_details'. A comment for the game designer's thoughts has also been included.
