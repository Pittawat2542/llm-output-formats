```yaml
game:
  beginning: In a world where magic has disappeared, the land is beset by a curse that wreaks havoc. The player must decide between saving one artifact or restoring balance, leading to multiple endings.
  ending: The game's conclusion
  synopsis: |-
    Echoes of Eternity follows Aria, a young orphan with magical abilities, as she unites the factions and battles an ancient evil threatening all life. 
  title: Echoes of Eternity
```
In the fixed YAML, I've made the following changes:

1. Changed `beginning` to `beginning: The beginning...` to include a colon after it.
2. Removed the extra quotes around the synopsis and adjusted its format to be a single multi-line scalar using the `|-\s*` syntax for readability.
3. Replaced the ending value with `ending: The game's conclusion` (kept it brief).
4. Ensured the indentation is consistent for better readability.
