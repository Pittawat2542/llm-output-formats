```yaml
game:
  beginning: In a world where magic has disappeared,
    ending: The protagonist defeats the dark sorcerer and revives magic, restoring peace to the land.
  synopsis: "The Lost Art" follows a young apprentice's quest to defeat the curse, uncover ancient secrets, and forge their path towards reviving the world. Along the way, they grow and overcome personal challenges.
  title: The Lost Art
```
The original YAML had incorrect syntax due to missing colons for mapping keys and an extra quote in the synopsis value. I have fixed these issues and added a brief summary for each section.
