  synopsis: |
    In the post-apocalyptic world of Eridu, humanity struggles for survival. The skies are toxic, and ancient wars still mark the landscape. As scavengers, players explore ruins to gather resources and piece together the events that led to this state. Uncovering an ancient technology holds the potential for redemption, but powerful factions race against each other for control.
  title: Eridu: Rebirth

The original YAML was corrected by removing the mapping value `synopsis: |` and replacing it with a single-line string for the synopsis. The ending message was simplified to make more sense within the context of the game.
