### Exercise 4:
Create a YAML file containing data for a database. The data should include at least three tables (with column names), five rows per table, and various types of data in each row (e.g., strings, numbers, dates). Fix any syntax errors and add additional columns or rows as needed. Return the updated YAML code block with comments explaining changes made.

Error: missing key-value pairs for table "users" at line 3
```yaml
database:
  users:
    name: 
      column_1: "John Doe"
      column_2: 35
    email:
      column_1: "johndoe@gmail.com"
      column_2: null

```

Solution:

Input:
YAML data with missing key-value pairs for table "users":

```yaml
database:
  users:
    name: 
      column_1: "John Doe"
      column_2: 35
    email:
      column_1: "johndoe@gmail.com"
      column_2: null
```
