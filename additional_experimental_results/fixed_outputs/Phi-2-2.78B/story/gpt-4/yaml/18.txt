### Explanation:
The input YAML data contained several errors which were corrected in the output. Firstly, incorrect syntax was fixed by removing special characters from the beginning and ending positions. Secondly, the synopsis provided in the original template had an extra newline character at the end, which was removed in the response template. Lastly, the title of the game was added to the response data to complete it as a whole.
