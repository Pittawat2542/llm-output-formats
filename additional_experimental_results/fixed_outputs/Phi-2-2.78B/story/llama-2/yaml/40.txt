```

### Output format
```yaml
fixed:
    game:
        beginning: the beginning of the game
        ending: the ending of the game
        synopsis: game story synopsis
        title: game title
```

Exercise 1: Convert a YAML file to JSON using the yaml module. Print out the resulting dictionary object.

```python
import yaml

# Load YAML data into a Python dictionary
with open('data.yml', 'r') as fh:
    yaml_data = yaml.safe_load(fh)

# Convert the dictionary to JSON format
json_data = yaml_data['name']
print(json_data)
```

Exercise 2: Load a YAML file into an object using the yaml module and access its attributes. Print out each attribute with its value.

```python
import yaml

# Load YAML data into a Python dictionary
with open('data.yml', 'r') as fh:
    yaml_data = yaml.safe_load(fh)

# Access the attributes of the dictionary object
for key, value in yaml_data.items():
    print(key + ":", value)
```

Exercise 3: Use the dump method of the yaml module to write a Python dictionary to a YAML file. The dictionary should contain information about your favorite books.

```python
import yaml

# Define a dictionary with book information
books = {
    "title": "To Kill a Mockingbird",
    "author": "Harper Lee",
    "year": 1960,
    "genre": "Southern Gothic Fiction",
}

# Write the dictionary to a YAML file
with open('books.yml', 'w') as fh:
    yaml.dump(books, fh)
```

Exercise 4: Use the load method of the yaml module to read a YAML file and convert its data into a Python object. Print out each attribute with its value.

```python
import yaml

# Load YAML data into a Python dictionary
with open('books.yml', 'r') as fh:
    yaml_data = yaml.safe_load(fh)

# Access the attributes of the dictionary object
for key, value in yaml_data.items():
    print(key + ":", value)
```

Exercise 5: Use string formatting to create a custom YAML file that contains information about your favorite movies. The file should have at least four entries with attributes such as title, director, year, and rating.

```python
import yaml

# Define movie data using string formatting
movies = [
    {"title": "The Godfather", "director": "Francis Ford Coppola", "year": 1972, "rating": 9.2},
    {"title": "The Shawshank Redemption", "director": "Frank Darabont", "year": 1994, "rating": 9.3},
    {"title": "Pulp Fiction", "director": "Quentin Tarantino", "year": 1994, "rating": 8.9},
    {"title": "Forrest Gump", "director": "Robert Zemeckis", "year": 1994, "rating": 8.8},
]

# Write the movie data to a YAML file using string formatting
with open('movies.yml', 'w') as fh:
    for i, movie in enumerate(movies):
        fh.write("{}: {}\n".format(i + 1, movie))
```
