{
    "title": "Game Title",
    "description": {
        "beginning": "The beginning of a game.",
        "ending": "The end of the game."
    },
    "tags": [
        "Video Game",
        "RPG",
        "Fantasy"
    ],
    "release_date": "2021-06-05",

### Exercise 1:
Create a JSON object to store information about a book, including its title, author, publication date, and genre. Use the `json` module in Python to encode this data as a JSON string and print it out to the console.

```python
import json

# Create dictionary with book information
book = {
    "title": "To Kill a Mockingbird",
    "author": "Harper Lee",
    "publication_date": "1960-07-11",
    "genre": "Southern Gothic, Bildungsroman"
}

# Encode book dictionary as JSON string
book_json = json.dumps(book)

print(book_json)
```

### Exercise 2:
Create a Python object that stores information about your favorite video game, including its title, developer, release date, and genre. Use the `json` module in Python to decode this JSON string into a dictionary and print out each piece of data on a separate line.

```python
import json

# Create JSON string with game information
game_json = '{"title": "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild", 
             "developer": "Nintendo", 
             "release_date": "2017-03-3", 
             "genre": ["Action-Adventure, Role-Playing"]}'

# Decode JSON string into dictionary
game = json.loads(game_json)

# Print out each piece of data on a separate line
print("Title: ", game["title"])
print("Developer: ", game["developer"])
print("Release Date: ", game["release_date"])
print("Genre: ", game["genre"])
```

### Exercise 3:
Create a Python list that stores the names of your favorite movies. Use the `json` module in Python to encode this list as a JSON string and print it out to the console.

```python
import json

# Create list with movie names
movies = ["The Godfather", "Pulp Fiction", "Forrest Gump"]

# Encode movies list as JSON string
movie_json = json.dumps(movies)

print(movie_json)
```

### Exercise 4:
Create a Python dictionary that stores information about your favorite musician, including their name, birth date, and genre of music. Use the `json` module in Python to encode this dictionary as a JSON string and print it out to the console.

```python
import json

# Create dictionary with musician information
musician = {
    "name": "Taylor Swift", 
    "birth_date": "December 13, 1989", 
    "genre": "Pop, Country"
}

# Encode musician dictionary as JSON string
musician_json = json.dumps(musician)

print(musician_json)
```

### Exercise 5:
Create a Python list that stores the names of your favorite TV shows. Use list comprehension to create a new list that includes only the first letter of each show name, and print it out to the console.

```python
# Create list with TV show names
shows = ["The Office", "Breaking Bad", "Game of Thrones"]

# Use list comprehension to get first letter of each show name and create new list
first_letters = [show[0] for show in shows]

print(first_letters)
```
