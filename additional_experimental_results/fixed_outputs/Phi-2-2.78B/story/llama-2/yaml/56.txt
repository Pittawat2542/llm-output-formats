# Game YAML Formatting

Game YAML formatting is a way to organize and structure your game's data in a standardized format that can easily be parsed by other systems. By using YAML, you can ensure that your game's data is consistent across different platforms and devices.

To use Game YAML, you will need to install the PyYaml library in Python. This can be done with pip:

```python
!pip install PyYaml
```

Once you have installed PyYaml, you can start using it to format your game's data in YAML format. Here is an example of a Game YAML file that stores information about a simple game:

```yaml
game:
  name: Super Mario Bros.
  version: 1.1
  release_date: 1985-10-13
  platforms:
    - 'Nintendo Entertainment System'
  genre: platformer
  synopsis: "Join Mario as he embarks on a journey to rescue Princess Peach from Bowser's castle."
  characters:
    - 'Mario'
    - 'Luigi'
```

In this example, we are using YAML to store information about the game "Super Mario Bros.", including its name, version number, release date, platform(s), genre, synopsis, and characters. The data is organized in a hierarchical structure, with each key representing a different aspect of the game.
