### Explanation:
- I used the `json` library to convert the response into a Python dictionary with keys for each field.
- In the `beginning` key, I added an extra item with the name "name".
- In the `storyline` key, I updated the storyline to include the characters Zelda and Navi.
- In the `ending` key, I added an extra item with the name "name".
- In the `storyline` key, I updated it to reflect that Link defeats Ganondorf and saves Hyrule with the help of his friends.
