# The Python Textbook for Intermediate Python Concepts - Chapter 3

## Section 1. Lists and List Methods

### Subsection 1.1: Introduction to Lists

In this subsection, we'll introduce the concept of a list in Python. A list is an ordered sequence of elements enclosed in square brackets `[]`. Elements can be of any data type including strings, integers, or even other lists. Each element in a list has an index which starts from 0 and goes up to n-1, where n is the length of the list.

```python
# Example: Creating a list
my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 3, 4.5]
print(my_list)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 3, 4.5]
```

### Subsection 1.2: Adding Elements to Lists

There are several ways to add elements to a list in Python. The most common methods are `append()`, `extend()`, and `insert()`. The `append()` method adds an element to the end of the list, the `extend()` method concatenates two lists together, and the `insert()` method inserts an element at a specified index.

```python
# Example: Adding elements using append(), extend(), and insert()
my_list = ['apple', 'banana']
my_list.append('orange')  # Append an element to the end of the list
print(my_list)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']

another_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.extend(another_list)  # Extend a list with another list
print(my_list)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 1, 2, 3]

my_list.insert(1, 'grape')  # Insert an element at the specified index (index is 0-based)
print(my_list)  # Output: ['apple', 'grape', 'banana', 'orange', 1, 2, 3]
```

### Subsection 1.3: Removing Elements from Lists

There are also several methods to remove elements from a list in Python. The most common ones are `remove()`, `pop()`, and `del`. The `remove()` method removes the first occurrence of an element, the `pop()` method removes the element at a specified index (or the last element if no index is provided), and the `del` statement can be used to remove elements by their index or slice.

```python
# Example: Removing elements using remove(), pop(), and del
my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
my_list.remove('banana')  # Remove an element by its value
print(my_list)  # Output: ['apple', 'orange']

my_list.pop()  # Remove the last element of the list (or the element at index 1 if no index is provided)
print(my_list)  # Output: ['apple']

del my_list[0]  # Remove an element by its index (index is 0-based)
print(my_list)  # Output: []
```

### Subsection 1.4: Accessing and Modifying Elements in Lists

We can access individual elements of a list using their index, and we can modify them by assigning new values to the same index. We can also use slicing to extract a portion of a list or assign a new list to an existing slice.

```python
# Example: Accessing and modifying elements in lists
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(my_list[0])  # Output: 1 (access the first element)
print(my_list[2:3])  # Output: [3] (extract a portion of the list starting from index 2 and ending at index 3-1)

my_list[1] = 5  # Modify an element by its index
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 5, 3, 4]
```

### Subsection 1.5: List Methods

Python provides many methods to manipulate lists, such as `sort()`, `reverse()`, and `count()`. The `sort()` method sorts a list in ascending order by default (or descending order if the reverse parameter is set to True), while the `reverse()` method reverses the order of elements in a list. The `count()` method returns the number of occurrences of an element in a list.

```python
# Example: Using list methods
my_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]
my_list.sort()  # Sort the list in ascending order (default)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 1, 3, 4, 5]

my_list.reverse()  # Reverse the order of elements in the list
print(my_list)  # Output: [5, 4, 3, 1, 1]

count = my_list.count(1)  # Count the number of occurrences of 1 in the list
print(count)  # Output: 2
```

### Subsection 1.6: List Comprehension

List comprehension is a powerful way to create new lists based on existing ones. It consists of an expression followed by a `for` loop, which iterates over each element in the original list and applies the expression to it. The resulting elements are then collected into a new list.

```python
# Example: Using list comprehension
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
squared_list = [x**2 for x in my_list]  # Create a new list with each element squared
print(squared_list)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]
```

## Exercises

1. Write a Python program that creates a list of even numbers from 1 to 10 using list comprehension.

   Ideas:
   - Use the modulo operator `%` to check if a number is even or odd.
   - Start with an empty list, and use a for loop to append each even number to it.
   - Alternatively, you can use a conditional expression inside the square brackets of list comprehension to filter out odd numbers.

   ```python
   even_list = [x for x in range(1, 11) if x % 2 == 0]
   print(even_list)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
   ```

2. Write a Python program that finds the sum of all elements in a list using a loop.

   Ideas:
   - Use a `for` loop to iterate over each element in the list.
   - Keep track of the running sum by adding each element to it.
   - Print the final sum after the loop is finished.

   ```python
   my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   total_sum = 0  # Initialize a variable for storing the sum
   for x in my_list:
       total_sum += x  # Add each element to the total sum
   print(total_sum)  # Output: 15
   ```

3. Write a Python program that removes all duplicates from a list and returns a new list with only unique elements.

   Ideas:
   - Use a `for` loop to iterate over each element in the list.
   - Keep track of seen elements by using an additional set or dictionary.
   - Add each element to the result list if it has not been seen before.
   - Print the final result after the loop is finished.

   ```python
   my_list = [1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 5]
   unique_list = []  # Initialize an empty list for storing unique elements
   seen_set = set()  # Initialize a set to store seen elements
   for x in my_list:
       if x not in seen_set:  # If the element has not been seen before, add it to the result list and seen set
           unique_list.append(x)
           seen_set.add(x)
   print(unique_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   ```

4. Write a Python program that flattens a nested list into a single list using recursion.

   Ideas:
   - Define a recursive function that takes a nested list as an argument.
   - If the argument is not a list (e.g., it's a string or an integer), return it as a single-element list.
   - Otherwise, use a for loop to iterate over each element in the list and call the same function recursively on each sublist.
   - Collect all the flattened elements into a result list using a global variable (e.g., a list or tuple).
   - Return the final result after the recursive calls are finished.

   ```python
   def flatten(lst):
       if not isinstance(lst, list):  # If the argument is not a list, return it as a single-element list
           return [lst]
       result = []  # Initialize an empty list for storing flattened elements
       for x in lst:  # Iterate over each element in the list
           result += flatten(x)  # Call the same function recursively on each sublist and add the resulting elements to the result list
       return result

   my_nested_list = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
   flat_list = flatten(my_nested_list)
   print(flat_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
   ```

5. Write a Python program that calculates the product of all elements in two lists using list comprehension.

   Ideas:
   - Use a `for` loop to iterate over each element in both lists simultaneously.
   - Multiply the corresponding elements together and collect them into a result list using list comprehension.
   - Print the final result after the loop is finished.

   ```python
   list1 = [1, 2, 3]
   list2 = [4, 5, 6]
   product_list = [x * y for x, y in zip(list1, list2)]  # Multiply corresponding elements together using zip and list comprehension
   print(product_list)  # Output: [4, 10, 18]
   ```
