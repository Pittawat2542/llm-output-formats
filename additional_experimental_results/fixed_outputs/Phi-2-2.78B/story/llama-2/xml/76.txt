```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>the ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```

### Explanation:
This problem requires fixing the incorrect syntax in XML. The error message indicates that there is a missing start tag (<) for the opening ```xml``` element on line 8, column 0. To fix this, we need to add a start tag before the opening ```title``` element. Additionally, there are no closing tags or attributes for the ```synopsis```, ```beginning```, and ```ending``` elements. We can fix this by adding corresponding end tags after each element and also removing any empty text between them.

### Example:
```python
# Create a dictionary with incorrect XML data
xml_data = {
    "game": {
        "title": "game title",
        "synopsis": "game story synopsis",
        "beginning": "the beginning of the game",
        "ending": "the ending of the game"
    }
}
# Convert dictionary to XML string with corrected syntax
corrected_xml = "<game>\n  <title>{title}\n  <synopsis>{synopsis}\n  <beginning>{beginning}\n  <ending>{ending}\n</game>".format(**xml_data)
# Print the result in XML format and Markdown code block
print("\n```xml" + "\n" + corrected_xml.replace('\n', '\n    ') + "\n```")
```
