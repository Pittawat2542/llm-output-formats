game:
  beginning: the beginning of the game
  ending: the ending of the game
  synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: The Return of the Hero

### Explanation:
The original data contained an invalid YAML structure. Since this is an exercise in Python, we will use a dummy dictionary to show how we could have fixed it:
```python
d = {'game':{}} 
d['beginning']='the beginning of the game'
d['ending']='the ending of the game'
d['synopsis']='game story synopsis'
d['title']='The Return of the Hero'
print(yaml.dump(d))
```
