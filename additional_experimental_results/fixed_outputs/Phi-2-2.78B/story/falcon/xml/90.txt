Corrected XML with new values for the beginning and ending tags. Output is in XML format, but only the XML in the Markdown code block (between ```xml and ```) is provided as output.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>Game Title</title>
	<synopsis>Game Story Synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>The Beginning of the Game</beginning>
	<ending>The Ending of the Game</ending>
</game>
```
