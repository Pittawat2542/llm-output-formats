### Exercise 5 Solution (Python Code)
```python
import yaml
from datetime import datetime

# read in YAML data file with datetime format
with open("game_data.yml", "r") as f:
    game_data = yaml.safe_load(f)

    # convert datetime strings to Python objects
    for key, value in game_data.items():
        if isinstance(value, str):
            if ":" in value:
                dt = datetime.strptime(value, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
                game_data[key] = dt

    # convert Python objects to strings and write to YAML file with datetime format
    with open("new_game_data.yml", "w") as f:
        f.write(yaml.dump(game_data))
```
