YAML.
```
### Python code solution:
To solve this question, we can use a combination of string manipulation and regular expressions to extract the correct YAML from the input message. 
First, we will define a helper function `is_valid_yaml` that checks whether a given text is valid YAML or not. We can use the `re` library in Python to perform this check. Here's an example implementation:
```python
import re
def is_valid_yaml(text):
    yaml_pattern = r"^\s*[\n]?-?\s*[\n]?[ \t]*(?:!|[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+: )[^\r\n]*"
    return bool(re.match(yaml_pattern, text))
```
Next, we can use this helper function to find all the valid YAML fragments in the input message. We can do this by splitting the message into lines and then checking each line for validity using our `is_valid_yaml` function. Here's an example implementation:
```python
def extract_yaml(message):
    yaml_fragments = []
    for line in message.split('\n'):
        if is_valid_yaml(line):
            yaml_fragments.append(line)
    return yaml_fragments
```
Finally, we can use string manipulation to remove the incorrect YAML fragments and replace them with the correct ones. We can do this by iterating over each fragment in the original list of YAML fragments and checking if it is valid or not. If it is valid, we simply append it to the new list of YAML fragments. Otherwise, we remove it from the original list and add a placeholder string (in our case, `''`) in its place. Here's an example implementation:
```python
def fix_yaml(message):
    yaml_fragments = extract_yaml(message)
    fixed_yaml = []
    for fragment in yaml_fragments:
        if is_valid_yaml(fragment):
            fixed_yaml.append(fragment)
        else:
            fixed_yaml.append('<scalar>')
    return '\n'.join(fixed_yaml)
```
Now, we can use our `fix_yaml` function to correct the YAML data in the input message:
```python
def fix_message(message):
    yaml = fix_yaml(message)
    return yaml
```
Here's an example usage of this function on our original input message:
```python
input_msg = '''YAML.
game:
beginning: in the world of Eridoria, where magic and technology coexist in a realm of wonder, the village of Brindlemark is plagued by a mysterious curse that has caused its crops to wither and its people to fall ill.
ending: with the help of the ancient tree's power, the hero defeats the dark sorcerer, shattering the curse and restoring balance to Eridoria. The villagers of Brindlemark rejoice, and the land begins to heal.
synopsis: 
"The Lost Oracle" is a tale of adventure and discovery as a young apprentice named Elian sets out on a perilous journey to uncover the source of the curse afflicting his village. Guided by an ancient prophecy, Elian must brave treacherous landscapes, avoid deadly creatures, and confront rival factions vying for power in Eridoria.

'''
output_msg = fix_message(input_msg)
print(output_msg)
```
This should output the following corrected YAML message:
```YAML.
