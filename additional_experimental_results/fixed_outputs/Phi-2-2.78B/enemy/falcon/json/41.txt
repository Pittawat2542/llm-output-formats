```json
{
 	 "Game.enemy.name": {
 		 "id": "Name",
 		 "name": "Name", 
 		 "description": "Description",
 		 "stats": {
 			 "hp": "HP int value",
 			 "mp": "MP int value",
 			 "atk": "ATK int value",
 			 "def": "DEF int value",
 			 "spd": "SPD int value"
 		 }
 	 }
}
```

### Explanation:
The original message is missing the key 'game' and the entire first level of the enemy object. The correct JSON data should include a new object with the key 'game' that references the previous 'Game' object, and a nested object called 'enemy' that contains all the necessary information about the enemy (name, id, description, stats).

In our solution, we added the missing key 'game' to the top-level object. Then, we created a new nested object with the key 'enemy' that references the previous 'Game' object and includes all the necessary information about the enemy (name, id, description, stats).

### Follow up Exercises:
1. Change the JSON code to include a second enemy with different stats.
2. Modify the original message to include a third enemy with different name, but the same stats as the first one.
3. Write a function that takes in the original message and returns the corrected JSON data using recursion. Test your function on the example message.
