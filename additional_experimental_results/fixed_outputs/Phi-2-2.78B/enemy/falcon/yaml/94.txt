### Explanation:
The original YAML data has a syntax error while scanning the block scalar. It is missing a ```# Markdown code block``` delimiter. The corrected YAML data includes this delimiter at the beginning and end of the block, as well as within the text to make it clear that it belongs to a code block.

### Code:
```python
import yaml
with open("game.yml") as file:
    data = yaml.safe_load(file)
print(yaml.dump(data, default_flow_style=False))
```
