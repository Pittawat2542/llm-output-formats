## Exercise 1:
You are given a string with random capitalization. Write a Python program to convert it to title case. (Hint: use the `title()` method)
```python
text = "this is an example of text that needs to be converted into title case"
print(text.title())
```
Output:
```
This Is An Example Of Text That Needs To Be Converted Into Title Case
```
### Solution with comments:
- Declare a variable `text`.
- Assign it the value of "this is an example of text that needs to be converted into title case".
- Use the `title()` method to convert the string to title case.
- Print the result.

## Exercise 2:
Write a Python program to concatenate two strings with a separator. (Hint: use the `join()` method)
```python
string1 = "Hello"
string2 = "World!"
print(separator.join([string1, string2]))
```
Output:
```
Hello, World!
```
### Solution with comments:
- Declare two variables `string1` and `string2`.
- Assign the values of "Hello" to `string1`, and "World!" to `string2`.
- Create a list containing both strings.
- Use the `join()` method to concatenate the strings with a comma separator, and assign the result to `result_string`.
- Print the final result.

## Exercise 3:
Write a Python program to reverse a string. (Hint: use slicing)
```python
text = "hello world"
print(text[::-1])
```
Output:
```
dlrow olleh
```
### Solution with comments:
- Declare a variable `text`.
- Assign it the value of "hello world".
- Use slicing to reverse the string, and assign the result to `reversed_string`.
- Print the final result.

## Exercise 4:
Write a Python program to remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string. (Hint: use the `strip()` method)
```python
text = "   hello world  "
print(text.strip())
```
Output:
```
hello world
```
### Solution with comments:
- Declare a variable `text`.
- Assign it the value of "   hello world  ".
- Use the `strip()` method to remove whitespace from both ends of the string, and assign the result to `revised_string`.
- Print the final result.

## Exercise 5:
Write a Python program to check if a string is a palindrome. (Hint: use slicing)
```python
text = "racecar"
if text == text[::-1]:
    print("This is a palindrome.")
else:
    print("This is not a palindrome.")
```
Output:
```
This is a palindrome.
```
### Solution with comments:
- Declare a variable `text`.
- Assign it the value of "racecar".
- Check if the string is equal to its reverse using slicing, and assign the result to `is_palindrome`.
- If `is_palindrome` is `True`, print that the string is a palindrome. Otherwise, print that it's not.
