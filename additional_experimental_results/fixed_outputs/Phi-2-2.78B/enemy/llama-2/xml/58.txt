### Explanation:

The error is in the incorrect syntax of the XML data. The id element is missing its value, and the name element is missing its content. Additionally, the description attribute does not have a quotation mark around the text. To fix these errors, we can modify the code as follows:
```python
def correct_xml(data):
    root = ET.fromstring(data)
    for child in root:
        if 'id' not in child.attrib or 'name' not in child.attrib:
            child.set('id', str(child.getparent().find('enemy').get('id')))
            child.set('name', child.text)
        if 'description' in child.attrib and child.attrib['description'] != '':
            child.set('description', f"{child.attrib['description']}">")
    return ET.tostring(root).decode()
```
This function takes an XML string as input, parses it into a tree using the `ET.fromstring()` method, and then iterates over each child element to correct any missing attributes or values. Finally, the corrected XML is returned as a string using the `ET.tostring()` method.
