## Exercise 1

Write a Python script that takes two numbers as input and calculates their sum, difference, product and quotient.

#### Solution
```python
x = int(input("Enter first number: "))
y = int(input("Enter second number: "))

sum = x + y
difference = x - y
product = x * y
quotient = x / y

print("Sum:", sum)
print("Difference:", difference)
print("Product:", product)
print("Quotient:", quotient)
```
### Explanation: 
This code uses the `input()` function to take two numbers as input from the user. The values entered by the user are then stored in variables `x` and `y`. We calculate the sum, difference, product and quotient of these two numbers using arithmetic operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`. Finally, we print the results using the `print()` function.

## Exercise 2

Write a Python program that takes a string as input from the user and counts the number of vowels in it.

#### Solution:
```python
input_string = input("Enter a string: ")
vowel_count = 0
vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
for char in input_string:
    if char.lower() in vowels:
        vowel_count += 1
print("Number of vowels:", vowel_count)
```
### Explanation: 
This code uses the `input()` function to take a string as input from the user. A variable `vowel_count` is initialized with a value of 0, which will keep track of the number of vowels in the string. We define a list `vowels`, containing all the vowel letters. Using a for loop, we iterate over each character in the input string. If the lowercase version of the current character is present in the `vowels` list, then it means that the current character is a vowel and we increment the value of `vowel_count`. Finally, we print the number of vowels using the `print()` function.

## Exercise 3

Write a Python program to find the factorial of a given number.

#### Solution:
```python
def factorial(num):
    if num == 0 or num == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return num * factorial(num-1)

number = int(input("Enter a positive integer: "))
print("Factorial of", number, "is", factorial(number))
```
### Explanation: 
This code defines a function `factorial()`, which takes an input number as argument. The base case of the recursive function is when the input number is either 0 or 1, in which case the function returns 1. For all other numbers, it multiplies the current number with the result of calling itself recursively with the input number minus one. We take a positive integer as input from the user using the `input()` function and call the `factorial()` function to calculate its factorial. Finally, we print the result using the `print()` function.

## Exercise 4

Write a Python program that takes two lists of integers as input and returns their common elements.

#### Solution:
```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
common_elements = []
for element in list1:
    if element in list2 and element not in common_elements:
        common_elements.append(element)
print("Common elements:", common_elements)
```
### Explanation: 
This code defines two lists `list1` and `list2`, containing a set of integers each. We define an empty list `common_elements`, which will store the common elements between these two lists. Using a for loop, we iterate over each element in `list1`. If the current element is present in `list2` and it has not already been added to the `common_elements` list, then we add it to the list using the `append()` method. Finally, we print the common elements using the `print()` function.

## Exercise 5

Write a Python program that takes a string as input from the user and removes all whitespace characters from it.

#### Solution:
```python
input_string = input("Enter a string: ")
result = ""
for char in input_string:
    if not char.isspace():
        result += char
print("String without whitespaces:", result)
```
### Explanation: 
This code uses the `input()` function to take a string as input from the user. We define an empty variable `result`, which will store the string without any whitespace characters. Using a for loop, we iterate over each character in the input string. If the current character is not a whitespace character (i.e., it is alphanumeric or special), then we add it to the `result` variable using the `+=` operator. Finally, we print the resulting string without any whitespaces using the `print()` function.
