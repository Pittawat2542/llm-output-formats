1. The Python code is missing a `print("Done")` statement at the end of each function block. To fix this, add `print("Done")` after each function block. 
2. You should also add appropriate docstrings to describe what each function does and its parameters.
3. Make sure to import any necessary modules or libraries before using them in your code.
4. It is a good practice to include comments throughout your code to explain the logic behind it.
5. Use meaningful variable names that convey their purpose clearly.
6. When calling functions, make sure to provide any required arguments and ensure they are of the expected type.
7. Test your code with different inputs to verify its correctness.
