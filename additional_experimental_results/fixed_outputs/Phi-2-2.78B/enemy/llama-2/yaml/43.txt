# game.yml
game: {
  enemy: {
    description: 'This is a description',
    id: 1,
    name: 'Enemy Name',
    stats: {
      atk: 100,
      def: 100,
      hp: 100,

    }
  }
}


# Solution Explanation:

The original YAML file contained a syntax error as it was missing a closing curly bracket at the end of the 'enemy' object. The code snippet used the PyYAML library to parse the YAML data into a Python dictionary, then corrected the syntax error by adding the missing closing curly bracket and printing out the resulting dictionary.
