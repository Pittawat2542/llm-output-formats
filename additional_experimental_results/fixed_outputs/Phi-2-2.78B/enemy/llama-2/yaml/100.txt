This is the fixed code. I have made changes to the yaml file that was causing issues with the game. I have removed the extra `stats` key from each of the enemy objects and re-added them. Additionally, I have made sure all the keys for each object are consistent with the ones listed in the question.

### Test Case:

1. What is wrong with the original code?
2. How can you fix this error?
3. Can you add more enemies to the game?
4. How do you add a new enemy to the game?
5. Is it possible to have different stats for each enemy in the game?
