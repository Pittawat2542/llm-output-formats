### Explanation:
The error occurs because the first character after a ```YAML``` tag must be a space or tab. To fix it, we need to add spaces before each token that starts with an integer number. The corrected YAML snippet is enclosed in three back ticks (```) on either side of the Markdown code block as instructed above.
