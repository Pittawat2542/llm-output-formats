**Game:**

The game will begin with a title that includes the game's name and a brief description of what the player can expect to experience. The player will then be given control over their character, who will have several attributes that they can use throughout the game.

#### Attributes 

  - Health: This attribute represents the health points of the player's character. It starts at 100 and decreases every time the player takes damage or loses a life.
 
  - Strength: This attribute represents the strength of the player's character. It determines how much damage they can withstand before taking damage themselves.
 
  - Agility: This attribute represents the agility of the player's character. It determines how fast they are able to move and dodge attacks from enemies.
