```yaml
# Markdown Code Block
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text: dialogue or narration
```

This is a simple exercise to test your understanding of the YAML syntax. The goal is to fix an incorrect YAML data by correcting the syntax and providing new values where needed. If there is nothing wrong with the original message, you only need to return the YAML in a code block format between ```yaml``` and ``````.
