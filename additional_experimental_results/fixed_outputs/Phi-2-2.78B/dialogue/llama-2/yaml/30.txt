This is an example of a valid YAML file for storing dialogue options and responses in a game engine. The `game.yaml` file contains a list of dialogue options with their corresponding speakers and text, which can be accessed using the syntax `dialogue['speaker']`. For instance, to retrieve the second option's speaker, we would use `dialogue[1]['speaker']`, which will return "Player 2". The order of the dialogues is also specified in the file.
