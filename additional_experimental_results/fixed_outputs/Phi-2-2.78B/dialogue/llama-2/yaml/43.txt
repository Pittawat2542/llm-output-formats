The input format for `games/dialogs.yml` is:
```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: text of dialogue or narration
```
```python
# Example using list comprehension to transform the input data into a more readable format
with open('games/dialogs.yml', 'r') as f:
    data = yaml.safe_load(f)['game']

    dialogues = [{'order': d['order'],
                  'speaker': d['speaker'],
                  'text': d['text']} for d in data['dialogues']]

    print(dialogues)
```

Output:
```python
[{'order': '1', 
  'speaker': 'Bob',
  'text': 'Hello, how are you?'}, 
 {'order': '2', 
  'speaker': 'Alice',
  'text': 'I'm good, thank you. And you?'}]
```

## Exercises:
1. Given a file `games/dialogs_transformed.yml`, where each line is in the format of "game_name: dialogue", write a Python script to create a list of dictionaries containing the game name and dialogue for each game, using list comprehension.
```python
with open('games/dialogs_transformed.yml', 'r') as f:
    data = yaml.safe_load(f)

    games = {d['game_name']: d['dialogue'] for d in data}

    print(games)
```

2. Given a list of dictionaries containing dialogue for each game, write a Python script to create a file `games/dialogs.yml`, where each line is in the format of "game_name: dialogue", using list comprehension.
```python
with open('games/dialogs.yml', 'w') as f:
    data = [f"{d['game']}: {d['text']}" for d in games.values()]

    for line in data:
        f.write(line)
        f.write("\n")
```

3. Given a file `games/dialogs.yml`, write a Python script to find and print the dialogue that is repeated by multiple speakers, using list comprehension.
```python
with open('games/dialogs.yml', 'r') as f:
    data = yaml.safe_load(f)['game']

    speakers = [d['speaker'] for d in data]

    duplicates = [d for d, count in collections.Counter(speakers).items() if count > 1]

    for speaker in duplicates:
        dialogue = [d['text'] for d in data if d['speaker'] == speaker]
        print(f"{speaker} said: {dialogue}")
```

4. Given a file `games/dialogs.yml`, write a Python script to find and print the game that has the longest dialogue, using list comprehension.
```python
with open('games/dialogs.yml', 'r') as f:
    data = yaml.safe_load(f)['game']

    longest_game = max(data, key=lambda d: len(d['text']))

    print(f"The longest dialogue is in the game {longest_game['game']}.")
```

5. Given a file `games/dialogs.yml`, write a Python script to find and print the game that has the shortest dialogue, using list comprehension.
```python
with open('games/dialogs.yml', 'r') as f:
    data = yaml.safe_load(f)['game']

    shortest_game = min(data, key=lambda d: len(d['text']))

    print(f"The shortest dialogue is in the game {shortest_game['game']}.")
```
