You can use XML to store and exchange dialogues in your game engine because it is a markup language that uses tags, attributes, and elements to represent data. The advantage of using XML is that it allows you to structure the dialogue data in a hierarchical way, similar to how you would use HTML for web pages. You can also use XPath expressions to select and manipulate the dialogue data based on its tag name or attribute value.

### Rules:
* You can't use any HTML tags or attributes.
* You can't use any CSS.
* You can't use any JavaScript.
* You can't use any other code.
* You can't use any images.
* You can't use any other files.
