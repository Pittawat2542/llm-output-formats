# Fixing Incorrect XML Data
## Problem:
The given XML data has some syntax errors that need to be fixed. The following are the changes required to correct the errors.
- In the first dialogue, the order element is missing. It should be added between `<order>` and `</order>`.
- In the third dialogue, the text element does not have an attribute named "type" that indicates the type of text content (dialogue or narration). The attribute should be added after `text:`.

### Solution:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>1</order>
			<speaker>Player</speaker>
			<text>Hey, how are you doing?</text>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue>
			<order>2</order>
			<speaker>NPC</speaker>
			<type>dialogue</type>
			<text>I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How about you?</text>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue>
			<order>3</order>
			<speaker>Player</speaker>
			<type>dialogue</type>
			<text>I'm good too. Just wanted to catch up with you.</text>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue>
			<order>4</order>
			<speaker>NPC</speaker>
			<type>dialogue</type>
			<text>That's nice of you. It's been a while.</text>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue>
			<order>5</order>
			<speaker>Player</speaker>
			<type>dialogue</type>
			<text>Yeah, we should hang out sometime.</text>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```
