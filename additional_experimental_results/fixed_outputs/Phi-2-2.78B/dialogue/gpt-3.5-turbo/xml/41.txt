#### Exercise 1: 
1. The first error is `not well-formed (invalid token)`, it means that the XML data is not properly structured, and there are some syntax errors. In this case, the error occurs on line 26 where the value of the order attribute should be a number. To fix this error, we need to change the value of the order attribute from `1` to `1` (or any valid number) and close the dialogue tag with the `</order>` tag.
2. The second error is also `not well-formed (invalid token)`, it means that another syntax error occurs on line 26. This time, the value of the speaker attribute should be enclosed in quotation marks (""), not just written as plain text. To fix this error, we need to change the value of the speaker attribute from `Player` to `"Player"`.
3. The third and fourth errors are correct, there is nothing wrong with these XML tags and their attributes.

```xml
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>1</order>
			<speaker>"Player"</speaker>
			<text>Hey, are you busy right now?</text>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue>
			<order>2</order>
			<speaker="NPC">NPC</speaker>
			<text>No, not really. What's up?</text>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue>
			<order>3</order>
			<speaker>"Player"</speaker>
			<text>I need your help with a quest. Can you join me?</text>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue>
			<order="4">NPC</order>
			<speaker="NPC">NPC</speaker>
			<text>Sure, I'd love to help. Where should we meet?</text>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```
