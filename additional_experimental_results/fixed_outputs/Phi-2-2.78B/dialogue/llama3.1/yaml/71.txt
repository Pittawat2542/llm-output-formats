 ```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: 1
    speaker: Player
    text: 
      What brings you to this village?
  - order: 2
    speaker: NPC
    text: 
      We haven't had a stranger here for years. What's your business?
  - order: 3
    speaker: Player
    text: 
      I heard rumors of a lost treasure hidden somewhere in the nearby forest.
```
Solution:
This code is supposed to be YAML data, so we need to convert it first. We can use a Python library like `yaml` to parse and format the data. Here's how to do it:

```python
import yaml

original_message = """
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: 1
    speaker: Player
    text: 
      What brings you to this village?
  - order: 2
    speaker: NPC
    text: 
      We haven't had a stranger here for years. What's your business?
  - order: 3
    speaker: Player
    text: 
      I heard rumors of a lost treasure hidden somewhere in the nearby forest.
"""
yaml_data = yaml.safe_load(original_message)
print(yaml_data)
```
