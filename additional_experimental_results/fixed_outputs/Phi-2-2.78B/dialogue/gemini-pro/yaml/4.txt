### Exercise:
1. Write a function that takes in a YAML file and fixes any incorrect syntax errors. Return the corrected YAML as a string. Use `yaml` library to read and write YAML data.
2. Create a Python script that reads the input YAML from Exercise 1, makes a copy of it using a function, and writes both files on separate text editors or virtual environments for each user's computer. 
3. Write another function that takes in two arguments: an existing YAML file and new data to be added to it. The function should add the new data to the YAML without modifying the original file. Return a modified YAML file as a string.
4. Modify the function from Exercise 3 to allow users to specify whether they want the newly generated YAML file to overwrite an existing one or create a separate new file. 
5. Write another Python script that reads the input YAML from Exercise 4, saves it in the specified directory with the appropriate filename and extension, and uploads it to a remote server using `ftplib` library.
