```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: 1
    speaker: Narrator
    text: In a world where magic has disappeared, a young apprentice named Eryndor Thorne sets out on a journey to rediscover the lost art.
- order: 2
    speaker: Eryndor
    text: I've been searching for years, but every lead ends in disappointment. Is it possible that magic is truly gone forever?
- order: 3
    speaker: Zephyr 
    text: Perhaps you're looking in the wrong places, young apprentice. Magic isn't something you find; it'rsomething you feel.
```

Solution:
To fix the incorrect YAML syntax, we need to remove the backslashes and ensure that every line ends with a newline character. The corrected YAML data will be valid.
