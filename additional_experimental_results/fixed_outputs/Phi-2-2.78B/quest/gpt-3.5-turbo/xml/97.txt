### Explanation:
In the original XML data, there are several errors that need to be fixed. First, the key 'quest_giver' is missing in the task element of the first task. This key is required for the game to function properly and cannot be ignored. Additionally, there are formatting issues with the tag names and attributes. The corrected XML data includes the necessary keys and has proper formatting.
