The original code had many errors. Here is my correction.

Error: <?xml version="1.0" ?> tag was not found in the input document.
Error: The attribute name 'order' is missing on the second task element.
Error: The attribute value for the 'title' property of the game element was not given a quotation mark or double-quote character around it.
```
