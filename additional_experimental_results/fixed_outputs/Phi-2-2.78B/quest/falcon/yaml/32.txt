The original message was: ```Error: key_completeness: The root of the result is not a dictionary.```
This was fixed by adding an empty dictionary as value for the key "objective" which should be a dictionary to hold the values for all tasks, i.e., location, objective and order.

game:
  description: quest description
  id: id
  objective: {task1_location: task1_location, task2_location: task2_location, ...}
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
  - description: task description
   location: task location
   objective: task objective
   order: task order
  title: quest title
