# Quest description
- You will need to track down the elusive Sorcerer King, but beware - the Sorcerer King is also seeking to reclaim the throne. You must be careful to not fall into their traps! 
- When you enter the castle, you will be transported to the outer chamber. There, you will meet the Sorcerer King's personal guard, who is in charge of maintaining security. 
- However, to gain access to the inner chamber, you must find a secret entrance. The guide knows where this entrance is, but is unwilling to share the information with you without a proper reward. 
  The guide leads you down a long hallway, unlocking doors along the way. Once you've reached the end, they open a secret door for you, revealing the inner chamber. You then enter the chamber and battle the Sorcerer King's monsters. 
- After a long and brutal battle, you are finally able to defeat the Sorcerer King. As a reward, you are granted the title of King! 
  title: King of the Sorcerer King's kingdom.
