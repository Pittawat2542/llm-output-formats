### Task 1:
Write a program that reads the file `my_game.yml`. 
Check if it is formatted correctly and display its contents on the screen.
If any errors are found, print them to the screen in YAML format.

#### Solution:
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
from yaml import safe_load


if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        with open('my_game.yml') as f:
            data = f.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("File my_game.yml not found")
        sys.exit(1)

    if data is None or data == '':
        print("YAML file empty")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    data = safe_load(data)
    print('---')
    for d in data:
        print(d)
