      - file: quest_info.yml


### Input:
game:
  description: quest description
  id: id
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
  - description: task description
    location: task location
    objective: task objective
    order: task order
  title: quest title
```


### Explanation:
1. The input is a YAML file called "quest_info.yml" that contains information about a game quest.
2. The output should be in markdown format, with the YAML data rendered correctly.
3. First, we need to fix the errors in the YAML data. In this case, the key 'game' is missing and needs to be added.
4. We then need to add the YAML file as input for rendering.
5. Finally, we can generate the markdown output with the rendered YAML data. 
6. The completed code block looks like:
```python
import yaml

def fix_yaml(input_file):
    with open(input_file) as f:
        data = yaml.safe_load(f)

    # Fix errors in YAML data
    if 'game' not in data:
        data['game'] = {}

    return data

def render_markdown(input_dict):
    output = ""

    # Render YAML to Markdown
    yaml.safe_dump(input_dict, indent=4)
    output += '---\n' + '-' * 50 + '\n\n' + output

    return output
```
