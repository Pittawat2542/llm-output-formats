The code block between ```json and ``` will be the fixed JSON. The original message is provided between ```json and ```. Return output in JSON format and only the JSON in the Markdown code block.
{
    "game": {
     "id": "id",
     "title": "quest title",
   "objective": "quest objective",
   "description": "quest description",
   "reward": "quest reward",
   "quest_giver": "quest giver",
   "tasks": [{
        "order": "task order",
        "objective": "task objective",
      "description": "task description",
      "location": "task location"
    }]
}

### Explanation:
1. The original JSON code block is missing the 'game' key, which should be a dictionary object.
2. Replace 'my game here' with an actual dictionary object, containing the necessary keys and values for a game object.
3. Add the correct 'key_completeness': key_completeness: The key 'game' is not a dictionary. This ensures that any future code will correctly identify if the 'game' key in a new JSON object is actually a dictionary or not. 
4. Use the provided message as an example of what the corrected JSON should look like.
