### Exercises

1. Create a task in YAML that requires the player to collect at least 10 items before they can proceed with their quest.
```yaml

2. Add a condition that checks if the player's inventory contains at least 5 of the required items before allowing them to continue with their quest.
```yaml
game:

  id: id
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
  - description: task description
    location: item location 1, item location 2, ..., item location 10
    objective: collect items
    order: task order
    conditions:
      - if (player.inventory.contains(item1) && player.inventory.contains(item2) && ... && player.inventory.contains(item10)) {
        continue; // allow the player to continue with their quest
      } else {
        alert("You need to collect at least 5 of the required items first!");
        return false; // end the quest
      }
  title: quest title
```

3. Create a task that requires the player to speak to a certain NPC before they can proceed with their quest.

  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
  - description: task description
    location: NPC location
    objective: speak to NPC

4. Add a condition that checks if the player's dialogue options match the correct response from the NPC before allowing them to continue with their quest.
```yaml
game:
  description: quest description
  id: id
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
  - description: task description
    location: NPC location
    objective: speak to NPC
    order: task order
    conditions:
      - if (player.speak(npc).match(correct_response)) {
        continue; // allow the player to continue with their quest
      } else {
        alert("You said the wrong thing! Try again!");
        return false; // end the quest
      }
  title: quest title
```
