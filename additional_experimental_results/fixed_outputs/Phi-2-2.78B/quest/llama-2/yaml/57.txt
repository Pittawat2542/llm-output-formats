The fixed code will output the same result as the previous one, which is a list of tasks to be completed in a quest game. The `yaml` file has been used to define the game, its objective and how the player can complete it. Here is the fixed version:
```python
# Example 1 - Fixed code with yaml
game = {
    "description": "A quest about a quest",
    "id": "1",
    "objective": "Find the quest giver",
    "quest_giver": "The quest giver",
    "reward": 5000,
    "tasks": [
        {
            "description": "Find the quest giver",
            "location": "The quest giver",
            "objective": "Find the quest giver",
            "order": 1
        },
        {
            "description": "Find the quest giver",
            "location": "The quest giver",
            "objective": "Find the quest giver",
            "order": 2
        }
    ],
    "title": "A quest about a quest"
}
