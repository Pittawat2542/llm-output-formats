```yaml
- name: Example YAML Configuration File
  hosts: my_vpc_instances
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: example
      annotations:
        name: yaml-configuration
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: example-container
        image: nginx
```

Explanation:
- The `example` label is specified in the `template/metadata.yaml` file, which is used to identify and select the template resources for the deployment.
- The `example` annotation is specified in the `template/annotations.yaml` file, which provides metadata about the template, such as its name and version.
