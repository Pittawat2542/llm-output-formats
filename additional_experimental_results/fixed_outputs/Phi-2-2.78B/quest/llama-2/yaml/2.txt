#### Answer 4:
```yaml
game:
  description: "This is a description for the quest."
  id: 1
  objective: "To complete this quest, you must find the object."
  quest_giver: "The quest giver."
  reward: "You will get a reward for completing this quest."
  tasks:
  - description: "Find the object"
    location: "Under the red rock"
    objective: "Find the treasure chest"
```

### Explanation:
This new answer adds a new task with location and objective details. The previous question had no such detail, so this is a great improvement to make the game more realistic and fun!
