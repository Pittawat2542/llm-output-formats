### Explanation:

In this instruction, we have a YAML file that contains some data about a game quest. We are instructed to fix the incorrect syntax errors in the code and provide new values where necessary.

First, let's look at the original YAML code and identify any mistakes or inconsistencies.
- The first mistake is that there is a missing `yaml` tag at the beginning of each file. This tag specifies the type of data being encoded and should always be included in a YAML file. 
- The second mistake is an incorrect syntax error in the middle of the file where we try to start a token with an invalid character (in this case, a ``). We need to make sure that all tokens are properly started or ended with the correct characters according to the YAML spec.
- A third mistake is that some tasks have multiple description lines and location lines without separating them properly by order. Each task should only have one line of description followed by one line of location, and they should be in order of completion (as determined by the `order` field). 


To fix these errors, we can use Python's built-in YAML library to parse the code and make corrections as needed. Here is a step-by-step guide:

1. Install the PyYAML library using pip:
```bash
pip install pyyaml
```
2. Load the original YAML file into Python by reading it in with `open()`, and then passing it to `pyyaml.load()`:
```python
import yaml
with open("original.yml") as f:
    data = yaml.load(f, Loader=yaml.FullLoader)
```
3. Fix the syntax errors by checking each token for invalid characters and adding `yaml` tags where necessary:
```python
for task in data["game"]["tasks"]:
    if "location" in task:
        task["location"] = f"<{task['location']}>"
    if "objective" not in task:
        task["objective"] = "<unspecified>"
```
This code checks each task for a `location` field, and if it exists, adds an `<...>` tag to surround the value. It also checks for an `objective` field that might be missing, and sets its value to `"<unspecified>"`. 
4. Sort the tasks by order of completion using Python's built-in sorting function:
```python
data["game"]["tasks"] = sorted(data["game"]["tasks"], key=lambda task: int(task["order"]))
```
This code uses a lambda function to convert the `order` field of each task into an integer, and then sorts the list in ascending order based on that value. This ensures that the tasks are ordered correctly according to their completion status. 
5. Write the corrected YAML data back out as a new file using `pyyaml.dump()`:
```python
with open("fixed.yml", "w") as f:
    f.write(yaml.dump(data, default_flow_style=False))
```
This code writes the corrected YAML data to a new file named `"fixed.yml"`, using the `default_flow_style=False` option to turn off pretty-printing (which can make the output more difficult to read). 

With these steps complete, we have successfully fixed the syntax errors in the original YAML code and created a new file with corrected data.
