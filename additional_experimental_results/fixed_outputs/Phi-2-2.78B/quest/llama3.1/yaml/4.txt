```yaml
game:
  description: quest description
  id: id
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:

    location: task location
    objective: task objective
    order: task order
  title: quest title
``` 
Explanation: The original YAML file was missing the `title: quest title` field. This can be added to the template by creating a new key in the `game` dictionary with the value "quest title".
