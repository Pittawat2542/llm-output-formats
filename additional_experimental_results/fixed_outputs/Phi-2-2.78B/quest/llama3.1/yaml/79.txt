### Exercise 5

Write a Python script that reads a YAML file containing information about different programming languages, including their names, popularity ratings (on a scale of 1 to 10), and year of creation. The data is structured as follows:

```yaml
languages:
  - name: Python
    popularity: 9.3
    year_created: 1991
  - name: Java
    popularity: 8.7
    year_created: 1995
  - name: JavaScript
    popularity: 7.9
    year_created: 1995
  - name: C++
    popularity: 5.6
    year_created: 1983
```

Write a program that reads this file and calculates the average popularity rating of all programming languages. The result should be printed to standard output in a sentence format, such as "The average popularity rating of these programming languages is 8.05."

### Exercise 5 Solution

To solve this problem, we can use Python's `yaml` module to read the YAML file and extract the necessary information. Then, we can compute the average popularity rating using a loop and the `sum` function. Finally, we can format the result as a sentence string and print it to standard output.

```python
import yaml

with open('languages.yml', 'r') as f:
    data = yaml.safe_load(f)

popularity_sum = 0
for language in data['languages']:
  popularity_sum += language['popularity']

avg_popularity = popularity_sum / len(data['languages'])

print(f"The average popularity rating of these programming languages is {avg_popularity:.2f}.")
```
