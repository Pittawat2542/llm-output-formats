### Explanation:
In this exercise, we are asked to fix the given incorrect XML data. The error message provided indicates that one of the required keys is missing from the XML structure. Our task is to locate and correct the key "quest_giver" in the xml.data file. After fixing the data, we need to return it as an XML string enclosed within ```xml``` tags. 

To fix the given incorrect XML data, we should first identify the missing key which is 'quest_giver'. Then we can modify our code accordingly by adding the missing key with the value of 'Archaeologist Jones'. Finally, we return the modified XML string enclosed within ```xml``` tags.
