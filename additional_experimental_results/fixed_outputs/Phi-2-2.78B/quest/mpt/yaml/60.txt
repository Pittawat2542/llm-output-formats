   location: task location
   objective: task objective
   order: task order
  title: quest title

Original:
```yaml
description:  "quest description"
id:  "id"
objective: "quest objective"
quest_giver: "quest giver"

### Instructions:
The next line in the code block is a YAML error. The key `key_completeness` should be replaced with `missing_keys`. Please insert this corrected line, and return it as output. If there is nothing wrong, only return the YAML in a code block (between ```yaml and ```). The original message is provided between ```yaml and ```. Return output in YAML format and only the YAML in the Markdown code block.
```python
import yaml # Importing YAML module
from pathlib import Path
# The path to a file that contains YAML data
path_to_file = str(Path("data/quest.yml")) 
with open(path_to_file) as stream:
    my_dict = yaml.load(stream, Loader=yaml.FullLoader) # Loading the YAML file

for key in my_dict.keys():
    # Checking for all keys in each dictionary
    if key != "missing_keys": 
        # If there is an error: 
        if not any(i in my_dict[key] for i in ["description", "id", "objective", "quest_giver", "reward"]):
            my_dict['missing_keys'] = [k for k in ['description', 'id', 'objective', 'quest_giver', 'reward'] if not any(i in my_dict[key] for i in ["description", "id", "objective", "quest_giver", "reward"])]
            print('missing_keys: ', my_dict['missing_keys'])
    else:
        # If there is no error
        if not any(i in my_dict[key] for i in ["description", "id", "objective", "quest_giver", "reward"]): 
            my_dict['missing_keys'] = [k for k in ['description', 'id', 'objective', 'quest_giver', 'reward'] if not any(i in my_dict[key] for i in ["description", "id", "objective", "quest_giver", "reward"])]
            print('missing_keys: ', my_dict['missing_keys'])
