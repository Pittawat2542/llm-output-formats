### Explanation: 
The first error in the code is a `SyntaxError`. This error occurs when there are invalid syntaxes. The error message provides more information on where the problem lies, such as `"while scanning for the next token found character '`' that cannot start any token". The issue here is that there is an extra double quote at the beginning of the line. This should be removed to fix the error.

The second error in the code is a `SyntaxError`. Similar to the first error, this error occurs when there are invalid syntaxes. The error message provides more information on where the problem lies, such as `"while scanning for the next token found character '`' that cannot start any token". The issue here is that the variable name "id" starts with a number, which is not allowed in Python. This should be fixed by renaming the variable to something else.

### Exercise 2:
Fix the following YAML data. Correct the syntax and provide new values if needed. If there is nothing wrong, only return the YAML in a code block (between ```yaml and ```). The original message is provided between ```yaml and ```. Return output in YAML format and only the YAML in the Markdown code block. YAML.
