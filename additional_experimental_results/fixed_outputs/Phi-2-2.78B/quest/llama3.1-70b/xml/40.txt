Answer:
To fix the XML data, we need to add an attribute `key_completeness` to each task element. We also need to provide a value for this key in the <description> tag of the first task element, as it is missing from the original message. Here's the corrected code:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<id>Q001</id>
	<title>The Lost City of Eldarath</title>
	<objective>Retrieve the ancient artifact from the ruins of Eldarath</objective>
	<description>Rumors have been circulating about a lost city deep within the nearby forest, where an ancient civilization once thrived. The city is said to hold many secrets and treasures, including a powerful artifact that could change the course of history.</description>

	<tasks>
		<task>
			<order>1</order>
			<objective>Gather information about the lost city from local villagers and travelers</objective>
			<description>Speak with the locals in the nearby village to gather any information they may have about the lost city. They may be willing to share rumors, stories, or clues that could aid you on your quest.</description>
			<key_completeness>missing</key-completeness>
		</task>
		<task>
			<order>2</order>
			<objective>Retrieve a map of the surrounding forest from the local cartographer</objective>
			<description>The local cartographer, a skilled mapmaker named Elara, may have created a detailed map of the surrounding forest. Acquire this map to help guide you through the treacherous terrain.</description>
			<key_completeness>missing</key-completeness>
		</task>
		<task>

			<description>Using the map obtained from Elara, make your way through the dense forest. Be cautious of wild beasts, treacherous terrain, and rival treasure hunters.</description>
			<key_completeness>missing</key-completeness>
		</task>
	</tasks>
</game>
```
Note that we have added a new element `key_completeness` to each task element. We have also provided a value of "missing" for this key, which is the correct value as per the XML syntax. The <description> tag of the first task element now includes this value, indicating that it is missing from the original message.
