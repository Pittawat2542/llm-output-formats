```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
  <character>
    <id>123456</id>
    <first-name>John Doe</first-name>
    <last-name>Doe</last-name>
    <species>Human</species>
    <age>30</age>
    <role>Protagonist</role>
    <background>John is a skilled detective who solves mysteries in a futuristic city.</background>

```

### Explanation:
The XML is incorrect due to an error in the syntax. The problem was caused by a missing `/>` tag, which should be added after each attribute value. Additionally, there are some minor mistakes such as misspelling "Doe" and using a comma instead of a semicolon between values.
