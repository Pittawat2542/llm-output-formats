The original yaml file generated by the code above is a valid YAML document that can be interpreted by PyYAML. 

### Explanation of how the solution works:

1. The code defines a function called `write_yaml_file` which takes three arguments - a path to a new YAML file, the name of a game character, and the content of the character's information as a dictionary.
2. In step 2 of the code, we open the specified file in write mode using the `open()` function with the parameter 'w'.
3. Then we use the `dump()` method provided by PyYAML to dump our contents into the newly opened file. We pass in the character data as a dictionary and provide it in a YAML-friendly format, which is returned by `yaml.safe_dump(character_data)`.
4. Finally, we close the file using the `close()` method of the `file` object. 

### Questions:

1. What is PyYAML used for? 
2. How do you import PyYAML in Python code? 
3. Can you create a YAML document manually in Python? 
4. Is it possible to read a YAML file programmatically using Python? If yes, how? 
5. What other modules can be used with PyYAML for more complex YAML operations?
