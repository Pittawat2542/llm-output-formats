    The following examples have been fixed in the latest version of the API documentation:
    - Example 4 has been corrected to remove the extra whitespace after each item.
    - Example 6 has been corrected to add a new line between "role" and "species".
    - Example 7 has been corrected to add a new line after "species".
    - Example 8 has been corrected to remove the extra whitespace before the "background" field.

    These corrections have been made as part of ongoing maintenance and updates to the API documentation, in order to ensure that users have access to accurate and up-to-date information about the features and functionality of our game engine.
