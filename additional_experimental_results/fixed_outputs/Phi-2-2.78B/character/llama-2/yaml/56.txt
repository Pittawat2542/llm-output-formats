This is the YAML data after fixing the error. No changes were made to the original data as it was already correct. 

## Instruction:
Use the following Python code block to generate a list of random numbers between 1 and 100 using the `random` module. Use list comprehension to create the list and write it in YAML format with indentation and new lines for each element. Return output in YAML format and only the YAML in the Markdown code block.
```python
import random 
numbers = [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(10)]
```
