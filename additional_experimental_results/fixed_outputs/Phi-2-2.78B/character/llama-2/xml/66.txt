**Problem Statement**: 

Write a python program that creates a game object and stores it into xml file.

**Expected Output**:

The output should be written to an xml file. The root element of the tree is created with the name "game", and has one child node called "character". Each character node will have its own attributes such as "id" (name), "first-name", "last-name", etc. Each of these nodes will also have a subelement, called "physical-appearance", which contains more information about the physical appearance of each character.

**Input Data Format**: 

The input data is given in string format and stored into the xml file as shown below:
```markdown
<game>
    <character>
        <id>id</id>
        <first-name>first name</first-name>
        <last-name>last name</last-name>
        <species>species</species>
        <age>exact age or description</age>
        <role>role of the character</role>
        <background>background story</background>
        <place-of-birth>location</place-of-birth>
        <physical-appearance>
            <physical-appearance>
                <eye-color>eye color</eye-color>
                <hair-color>hair color</hair-color>
                <height>height in float value</height>
                <weight>weight in float value</weight>
            </physical-appearance>
        </physical-appearance>
    </character>
</game>
```
**Example Input Data**:
```markdown
<game>
	<character>
		<id>12345</id>
