#### Output:

<xml version="1.0" ?>"""")

### Explanation:
The original XML is not well-formatted and contains syntax errors, so we need to correct it before processing it further. 

First, let's fix the "invalid token" error by closing the `</game>` tag with an opening one at line 22 and column 0. This should result in:
```xml
<game>
	<character>
		<id>id</id>
		<first-name>first name</first-name>
		<last-name>last name</last-name>
		<species>species</species>
		<age>exact age or description</age>
		<role>role of the character</role>
		<background>background story</background>
		<place-of-birth>location</place-of-birth>
		<physical-appearance>
			<physical-appearance>
				<eye-color>eye color</eye-color>
				<hair-color>hair color</hair-color>
				<height>height in float value</height>
				<weight>weight in float value</weight>
			</physical-appearance>
		</physical-appearance>
	</character>
</game>
```

Next, we need to make sure the XML is valid by checking for any missing or extra tags. Since all of our tags are present and there are no extraneous ones, we can move on to processing the data further.
