#### Answer:

The correct XML data is provided between the ```xml and ``` tags. The error message indicates that there are mismatched tags in the original XML code, specifically on line 10, column 2. To fix this error, we need to ensure that all tags have proper closing brackets and their corresponding opening brackets match.

In this case, the incorrect syntax is due to missing closing brackets for some elements. We can correct this by adding the appropriate closing brackets where necessary.

Here's the fixed XML code:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<character>
		<id>id</id>
		<first-name>first name</first-name>
		<last-name>last name</last-name>
		<species>species</species>
		<age>exact age, including decimal part if applicable</age>
		<role>exact role of the character</role>
		<background>background story</background>
		<place-of-birth>location</place-of-birth>
	</character>
</game>
```

The corrected XML code now has no syntax errors and all tags are properly closed. It is now ready to be used for further processing or display.
