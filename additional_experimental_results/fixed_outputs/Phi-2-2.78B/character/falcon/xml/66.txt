### Explanation: 
The original XML was not properly formatted with the correct syntax. The ```xml''' tag is missing and there are mismatched tags in line 17, column 2. To fix this error, we need to add the necessary ```xml''' tags before each opening tag and close all tags when done. We also need to change "id" to id="id" and remove the quotation marks from first-name and last-name.
The original XML is also missing a value for the species tag. To fix this, we simply add an empty species= attribute. 
Finally, we need to make sure that all text inside of tags are properly enclosed with angle brackets (<>). In the case where there is only one value for a particular attribute, such as age or weight, we can use the singular form without quotation marks. In the case where there are multiple values, we add quotes around each individual value, separated by commas. We also need to make sure that all text within a tag is properly closed with </>. 
Overall, these changes should result in a properly formatted XML.
