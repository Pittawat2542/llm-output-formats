### Explanation:
The original YAML data had incorrect syntax, as well as some wrong values. The errors were identified by running a tool called "pyyaml" on the given input. It is important to have correct syntax in YAML files because they are used for representing data structures in a human-readable format. Any mistake in the YAML file can lead to incorrect interpretation of data, which can cause problems while using the program that reads the YAML file.
In this case, there were two major errors: 
1. The first error was caused by a character that cannot start any token and had a wrong value. This error occurred when the variable "age" was defined in the character field and its value was set to `bold` or `bold|age`. YAML does not allow variables that start with any special characters, including `bold`, as they are reserved for other purposes.
2. The second error was caused by an incorrect syntax when defining the physical_appearance section of the character field. The value of "height" and "weight" were separated by a vertical bar instead of being concatenated to form a single string, which is not allowed in YAML. 
To fix these errors, we had to replace the wrong values with the correct ones and remove any special characters that are reserved for other purposes. We also had to concatenate the values of "height" and "weight" into a single string using the `+` operator instead of a vertical bar. After fixing the errors, we re-ran pyyaml on the updated file to ensure that it was syntactically correct before returning it in YAML format.
