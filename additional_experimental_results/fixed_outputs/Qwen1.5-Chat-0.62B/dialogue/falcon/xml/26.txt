```
In this corrected version, the `order` element has been correctly placed after `dialogue or narration`. The `order` value is now set to `dialogue order`, which is a valid XML syntax. The `dialogue` element is now properly nested in the `dialogues` array and contains all of the `dialogue` elements that are being displayed.

In the code block, the new variable `order` is used to specify the order for each dialogue, which is now set to `dialogue order`. The `dialogue` element is now properly nested in the `dialogues` array and contains all of the `dialogue` elements that are being displayed.

The `submit` button has been changed to `displayResult()`, which will display a message indicating that the form has been submitted. This message includes the input value for each dialogue, as well as a submit button that will trigger the display of the results.
