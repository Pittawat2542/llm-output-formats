	<h1>Welcome to My Game!</h1>
	<p>This is a game for two players. The game has four different levels:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Level 1</b>: You are in the middle of the maze and must navigate through the maze.</li>
		<li><b>Level 2</b>: You have to solve a puzzle in order to progress.</li>
		<li><b>Level 3</b>: You need to talk to a character to gain experience.</li>
		<li><b>Level 4</b>: You must defeat a boss in order to win the game.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This is just a small sample of what you can do in my game. I hope this helps! If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to ask.</p>
