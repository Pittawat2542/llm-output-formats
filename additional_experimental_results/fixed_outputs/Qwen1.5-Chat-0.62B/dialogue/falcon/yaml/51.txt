```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - speaker: speaker name
    text: dialogue or narration
```
The syntax in the original YAML file is incorrect. The `text` variable should be replaced with the content of a dialogue, and the `lines` argument should be changed to match the number of lines that need to be formatted.
Here's the corrected code:
```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - speaker: speaker name
    text: dialogue or narration
    lines: 8
```
The output in YAML format will be:
```
game
    dialogues:
       - speaker: speaker name
        text: dialogue or narration
        lines: 8
```
The Markdown code block with the correct YAML data is provided between ```yaml and ```.
