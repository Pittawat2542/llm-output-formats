```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
     - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text: dialogue or narration
  character: character name
    YAML: |  
      order: YAML order
      speaker: speaker name
      ->: YAML block of characters or words
```
Here is the code that fixes the syntax and provides new values if needed:
```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
     - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text: dialogue or narration
    character: character name
    YAML: |  
      order: YAML order
      speaker: speaker name
      ->: YAML block of characters or words
    ->: { return: speaker name }    
```
The output is now:
```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
     - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text: dialogue or narration
    character: character name
    YAML: |  
      order: YAML order
      speaker: speaker name
      ->: YAML block of characters or words
```
The only new value in the code is the line that says `|` instead of `|`, which is used to make sure that each YAML block is on a separate line.
