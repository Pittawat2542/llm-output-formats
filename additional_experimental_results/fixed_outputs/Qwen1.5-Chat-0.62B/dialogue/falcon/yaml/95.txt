The correct YAML data is provided between ```yaml and ```.
```yaml
[dialogues]
  order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text: My dialogue goes here!
- speaker: speaker name
- text: My dialogue goes here!
```

The output in YAML format is:
```yaml
game - Output in YAML format
game_dialogues
  Speaker: speaker name
  Text: My dialogue goes here!
```

Here's the Markdown code block with the corrected YAML data:

```markdown
[dialogues]
  order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text: My dialogue goes here! - Output in YAML format

game â€“ Output in YAML format
game dialogues
  Speaker: speaker name
  Text: <insert dialogue text here>
```

Note that there's no need to modify the Markdown code. The correct YAML data is provided between ```yaml and ```.
