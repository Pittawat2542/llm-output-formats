The syntax for the YAML data is correct. Here's the corrected code:
```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
```

Output in Markdown format:
```markdown
游戏:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
```

The only difference is the addition of an extra colon (`;`) after the line containing the `order` keyword. This makes the YAML more readable and easier to understand.
