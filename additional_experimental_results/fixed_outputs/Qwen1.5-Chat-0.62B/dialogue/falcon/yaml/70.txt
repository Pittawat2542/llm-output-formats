Here is the corrected YAML data with new values for the correct syntax and properly formatted content:

```
>   <document start>
    game:
      dialogues:
       - order: dialogue order
        speaker: User
        text: "I heard that we needed to hurry up."
      </document>
  <block mapping start>
    game:
      dialogues:
       - order: dialogue order
        speaker: User
        text: "I heard that we needed to hurry up." 
    key: text
    text: "I heard that we need to hurry up."
  </block>
```

And here is the code in Markdown format:

```
```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
     - order: dialogue order
      speaker: User
      text: "I heard that we needed to hurry up."

game:
  dialogues:
     - order: dialogue order
        speaker: User
        text: "I heard that we needed to hurry up."
    key: text

game:
  dialogues:
     - order: dialogue order
        speaker: User
        text: "I heard that we needed to hurry up."

game:
  dialogues:
     - order: dialogue order
        speaker: User
        text: "I heard that we needed to hurry up."
```
