```yaml
# Markdown code block - only the YAML
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text: dialogue or narration
```

The YAML data is correct now. The error message was caused by a missing key `order`. Now, the YAML data looks like this:
```yaml
- order: dialogue order
```

In the Markdown code block, it should be:

```yaml
# Markdown code block - only the YAML
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text: dialogue or narration
```
