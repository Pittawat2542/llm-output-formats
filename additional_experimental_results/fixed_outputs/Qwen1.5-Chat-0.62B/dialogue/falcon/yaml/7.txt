```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker_name
    text: "Order: dialogue or narration"
```
The issue with the original YAML message is that the key 'game' is missing. To fix this, you can add a key-value pair in the `game` section, like this:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker_name
    text: "Order: dialogue or narration"
    game: game
```
The YAML message should now be correct and ready to use.
