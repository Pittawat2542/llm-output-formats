Here is the corrected YAML data:
```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
```

The syntax has been corrected and there are no errors. The new values that need to be provided include the `order` variable, which is now set to the `dialogues` key with a value of `- order`. The `order` variable specifies the order in which the dialogues will take place. The new output for this example would be:
```
speaker:
    name: character name
```
