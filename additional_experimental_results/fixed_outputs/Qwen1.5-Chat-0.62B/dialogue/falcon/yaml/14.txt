The YAML data looks correct. The problem lies in the line that is missing a colon after the `order:` key. The correct syntax for this key should be:

```
game:
  order:
    speaker: speaker name
    text: dialogue or narration
```

This will create a new line with a colon and the appropriate value for the `order:` key. If you would like to fix the code, please provide the original YAML data so I can take a look at it again.
