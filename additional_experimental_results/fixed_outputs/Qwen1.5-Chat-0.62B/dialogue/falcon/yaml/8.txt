The YAML data you provided is correct. Here's the corrected YAML code:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text: dialogue or narration
    message_text: "Hello, world!"
```

Note that I removed the incorrect syntax for scanning for the next token `:` at line 6 in the original YAML code. Also, I updated the values of `order`, `speaker`, and `text` to match the structure of the new YAML data.
