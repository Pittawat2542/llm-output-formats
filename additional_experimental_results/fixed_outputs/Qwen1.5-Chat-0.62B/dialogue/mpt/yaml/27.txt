Here's the Markdown code block that includes the corrected YAML data:

|1| Alice| As I was saying, there's been an enormous increase in violent crimes in our town. This is a real issue.'|
|2| Alice| In fact, the last census showed an astonishing 80% increase in registered offenders in the last year. It's pretty much out of control.'|
|3| Alice| But I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. The unemployment rate has been steadily climbing for the past few years. |
|4| Alice| It's really depressing.'|
