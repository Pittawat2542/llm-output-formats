The correct YAML data is:
```
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: dialogue order
     speaker: player name
     text: "Hey there, how are you?" and "I'm very well, it's a pleasure to meet you."
```

Here is the output in Markdown format:
```markdown
# Game

# Dialogues

## Order 1
player: Player
text: "Hey there, how are you?"

## Order 2
 NPC: NPC
text: "I'm very well, it's a pleasure to meet you."

```
This code will output the correct YAML data in Markdown format.
