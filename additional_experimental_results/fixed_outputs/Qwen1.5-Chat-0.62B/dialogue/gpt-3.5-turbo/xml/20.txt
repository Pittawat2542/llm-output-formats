The correct syntax is:
```
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>1</order>
			 speaker>Player</speaker>
				text>Hey, how are you?</text>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue>
			<order>2</order>
			 speaker>NPC</speaker>
			 text>I'm good, thank you. How about you?</text>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue>
			<order>3</order>
			 speaker>Player</speaker>
				text>I'm doing great too. Thanks for asking.</text>
		</dialogue>
	</game>
</game>
```

New values if needed:
- `order` is now set to 1
- `speaker` should be set to the player's name instead of "Player"
- `text` should be updated to reflect the order of the dialogues.
