Output in Markdown code:

  <body>
    <game>
      <dialogues>

```
The original message was provided between `<game>` and `<dialogues>`, which were not properly nested. The corrected code now correctly nestles the `dialogues` element within the `<game>` element, so that it appears in the correct location at the end of the XML document.
