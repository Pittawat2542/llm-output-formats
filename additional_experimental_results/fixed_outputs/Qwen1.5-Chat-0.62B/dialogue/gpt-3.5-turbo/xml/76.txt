Here is the corrected XML data:
```
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
			<dialogue>
				<order>2</order>
				speaker>NPC</speaker>
				text>I'm doing well, thank you! How about you?</text>
			/dialogue>
			<dialogue>
				<order>3</order>
				speaker>Player</speaker>
				text>I'm good too, thanks for asking. So, what have you been up to?</text>
			-dialogue>
			<dialogue>
				<order>4</order>
				speaker>NPC</speaker>
				text>Not much, just been working on some projects.</text>
			_dialogue>
		...</dialogues>
	</game>
</game>
```
The code block now follows the standard XML structure.
