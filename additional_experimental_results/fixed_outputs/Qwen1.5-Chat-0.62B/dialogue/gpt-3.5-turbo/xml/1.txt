	</dialogues>
</game>
```

Explanation:

1. The `<?xml version="1.0"?>` tag is used to indicate the content of this XML document.
2. The `<game>` tag represents the root element for the XML document, which has a single child element called `<dialogues`.
3. Inside the `<dialogues>` tag, there are two new elements: `<dialogue>` and `<order>`. The `<dialogue>` element is used to describe a dialog between two speakers, and the `<order>` element specifies the order of the dialogue.
4. In the `<dialogue>` element, there is a new line with a different text format than before, which is necessary to create a valid sentence in the original code block. The new text format is specified by the `<order>` element as "dialogue or narration".
