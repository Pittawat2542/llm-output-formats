The correct YAML data is as follows:
```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
```

The output in Markdown format is: `game: dialogue orders Speaker Text`
You can run this code to check if the syntax and values of the YAML data are correct. If there's nothing wrong, only the correct YAML data in the Markdown code block should be provided.
