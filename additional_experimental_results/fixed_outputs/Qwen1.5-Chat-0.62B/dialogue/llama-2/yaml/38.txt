The YAML data provided is correct and should not contain any errors. Here are the new values for each field:

* `order`: " dialogue order"
* `speaker`: "player name"
* `text`: "dialogue or narration"

Note that if there were any issues with the original message, they may not have been specified in the YAML data itself, which is why they will be ignored.
