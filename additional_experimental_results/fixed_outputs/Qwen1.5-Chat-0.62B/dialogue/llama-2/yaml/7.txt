```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
```
Note: The previous code block is incorrect. The correct syntax for a YAML data structure with multiple lines is to use `<>` to represent a line of text, and the `>` symbol to represent a token in the JSON format.
```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
```
Now, you can create an example YAML data structure with multiple lines using this syntax.
