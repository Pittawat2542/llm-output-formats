Here is the corrected XML data:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?> 
<game>
	<dialogues>
			<dialogue>
				<order>dialogue order</order>
				SpeakerName speakerName
				textOrNarration textOrNarration
			</dialogue>
		</dialogues>
</game>
```

The syntax was correctly corrected and the values were provided as expected. The output in Markdown format is as follows:
``` markdown
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
			<dialogue>
				<order>dialogue order</order>
				SpeakerName speakerName
				textOrNarration textOrNarration
			</dialogue>
		</dialogues>
</game>
```

The code block is between the two `<dialogues>` tags, and there are no new values provided.
