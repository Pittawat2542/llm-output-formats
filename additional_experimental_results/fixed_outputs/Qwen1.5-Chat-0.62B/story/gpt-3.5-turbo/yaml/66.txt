The corrected YAML data is:
```
game:
  beginning: In the small town of Oakville, strange occurrences have been happening lately. People have reported seeing mysterious figures lurking in the shadows and unexplained noises in the night.
  ending: The end of the game
  synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: game title
```

The new values needed to fix the syntax are:
- `beginning` should be replaced with `end of the game`
- `ending` should be replaced with `end of the game`
