The incorrect syntax in the XML data is causing it to not be well-formed and invalid. It should read:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>Elysia's Lost Kingdom</title>
	<synopsis>The story of a brave hero who must journey through treacherous terrain, overcome dangerous creatures, and solve intricate puzzles to uncover the secrets of Elysia's lost kingdom.</synopsis>
	<beginning>In the peaceful kingdom of Elysia, darkness looms as the evil sorcerer Zephyr threatens to enslave its inhabitants. The king, desperate for assistance, calls upon a legendary hero to undertake the dangerous quest to defeat Zephyr and restore peace to the land.</beginning>
	<ending>The journey takes many twists and turns, but finally the hero reaches the sorcerer's lair atop Mount Hades. In a climactic battle, the hero uses a combination of skill, wit, and the power of the ancient relics collected throughout the quest. With the sorcerer defeated, the kingdom rejoices as the hero returns triumphantly.</ending>
</game>
```

The new code should look correct with the syntax fix.
