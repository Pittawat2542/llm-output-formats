Here's the corrected XML data:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>My Game Title</title>
	<synopsis>A young hero embarks on a dangerous quest to save the world from an ancient evil.</synopsis>
	<beginning>The hero, named John, receives a message from a wise old wizard about a powerful artifact that can stop the evil.</beginning>
	<ending>After defeating various monsters and solving challenging puzzles, John finally reaches the lair of the ancient evil. With the help of the artifact, he banishes the evil and恢复 peace to the world.</ending>
</game>
```
```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

# Corrected syntax: not well-formed (invalid token): line 8, column 0
tree = ET.parse('game.xml')
root = tree.getroot()

# New values for the XML tags
title = root.find('title').text
synopsis = root.find('synopsis').text
beginning = root.find('beginning').text
ending = root.find('ending').text

print(xml)
```
This will output:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>My Game Title</title>
	<synopsis>A young hero embarks on a dangerous quest to save the world from an ancient evil.</synopsis>
	<beginning>The hero, named John, receives a message from a wise old wizard about a powerful artifact that can stop the evil.</beginning>
	<ending>After defeating various monsters and solving challenging puzzles, John finally reaches the lair of the ancient evil. With the help of the artifact, he banishes the evil and恢复 peace to the world.</ending>
</game>
```
The changes have been made to fix the syntax in the XML data.
