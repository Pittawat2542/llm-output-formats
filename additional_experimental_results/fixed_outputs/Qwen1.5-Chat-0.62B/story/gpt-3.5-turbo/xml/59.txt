Here's the corrected XML data:
```
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>Assassin's Creed: Valhalla</title>
	<synopsis>In Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, you play as Eivor, a Viking raider who leads your clan from the harsh lands of Norway to the untamed kingdoms of England. Set in the 9th century, the game explores the violent clash between the Vikings and the kingdoms of England during the Viking Age. As Eivor, you must build your settlement, form alliances, and wage epic battles to secure a future for your people.</synopsis>
	<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>The end of the game</ending>
</game>
```

The syntax in the original message has been corrected, and new values have been added if necessary. The modified XML data includes the title, synopsis, and beginning/ending of the game sections.
