Here's a corrected version with the correct syntax:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>the end of the game</ending>
</game>
```
Note that I added `<?xml version="1.0"?>` at the end to indicate that this is an XML document, and not a regular programming language such as Java or Python.
