The issue with the YAML data is that it is missing a closing `.` after the `beginning` and `ending` keywords. In the code block provided, the correct syntax for the opening `.` should be used to close the `.`. Here is the corrected YAML data:
```yaml
game:
  title: Tutorial Game
  beginning: 2020-12-04 13:56:27.123456789
  ending: 2020-12-04 14:00:35.6789
  synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: Game Title
```

The new values provided are:
- `beginning` = 2020-12-04 13:56:27.123456789
- `ending` = 2020-12-04 14:00:35.6789
- `synopsis` = game story synopsis

The output in YAML format is:
```yaml
game:
  title: Tutorial Game
  beginning: 2020-12-04 13:56:27.123456789
  ending: 2020-12-04 14:00:35.6789
  synopsis: game story synopsis
```

The output in Markdown code block is:
```markdown
Template: Tutorial Game

beginning:
2020-12-04 13:56:27.123456789
ending:
2020-12-04 14:00:35.6789
synopsis: game story synopsis
```

This code block provides the correct YAML data with the correct syntax and values, and it is only the YAML in the Markdown code block.
