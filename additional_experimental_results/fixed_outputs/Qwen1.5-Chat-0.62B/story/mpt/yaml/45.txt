game:
  beginning: In the year 2035, in an alternate universe much like our own, a new drug made from the venom of genetically modified spiders has hit the streets of North America. After only a few months in mass production and distribution by an organized drug-smuggling cartel, the drug has quickly become the focus of the Federal Government. This is where you enter the picture: you are an ordinary man, not a drug dealer or a trafficker, not even an undercover agent, just an ordinary man who was sucked into the events and the turmoil around this drug.
  ending: The end of the game
