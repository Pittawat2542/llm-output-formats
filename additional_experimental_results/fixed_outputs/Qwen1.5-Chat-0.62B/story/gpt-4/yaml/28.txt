The YAML code provided does not have any syntax errors. It appears to be a template with the following structure:

```
game:
  beginning: the beginning of the game
  ending: the ending of the game
  synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: game title
```

To fix this issue, you can add some indentation and formatting to the code:

```
game:
  begining: "Your character wakes up in a post-apocalyptic world, with no memory of what has happened. The world you once knew is now a desolate wasteland."
  end:
    after going through numerous trials and tribulations, "You manage to defeat the nefarious villain and bring hope back to the world."
    "In a post-apocalyptic world, you as the main character wake up with no memory and must navigate through countless horrors to defeat a powerful villain, uncover the mystery behind the world's end, and ultimately bring hope back. Throughout this thrilling journey, you also discover your own true identity."

Now, let's return the correct YAML format with new values:

```
game:
  beginning: "Your character wakes up in a post-apocalyptic world, with no memory of what has happened. The world you once knew is now a desolate wasteland."
  end:
    after going through numerous trials and tribulations, "You manage to defeat the nefarious villain and bring hope back to the world."
    "In a post-apocalyptic world, you as the main character wake up with no memory and must navigate through countless horrors to defeat a powerful villain, uncover the mystery behind the end, and ultimately bring hope back. Throughout this thrilling journey, you also discover your own true identity."
  synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: game title
```

And here's the Markdown code block:

```yaml
game:
beginning: "Your character wakes up in a post-apocalyptic world, with no memory of what has happened. The world you once knew is now a desolate wasteland."
end:
after going through numerous trials and tribulations, "You manage to defeat the nefarious villain and bring hope back to the world."
"In a post-apocalyptic world, you as the main character wake up with no memory and must navigate through countless horrors to defeat a powerful villain, uncover the mystery behind the end, and ultimately bring hope back. Throughout this thrilling journey, you also discover your own true identity."
 synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: game title
