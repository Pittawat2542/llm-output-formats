The provided YAML data does not appear to be properly formatted or have any syntax errors. Without proper formatting, it is impossible to determine which parts of the code block are missing and how to fix them.
However, assuming that there is no syntax error in the code, I can provide some suggestions on what the YAML data should look like:
```yaml
game:
  beginning: the beginning of the game
  ending: the ending of the game
  synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: game title
```

This structure uses a single line of YAML to define the beginning and end of the game, as well as a description of the game's story. If you have any specific questions or feedback on this structure, please let me know and I can provide more specific guidance.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
