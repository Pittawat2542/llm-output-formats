```yaml
# YAML data
game:
  beginning: the beginning of the game
  ending: the ending of the game
  synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: game title
end {
  # Output in Markdown format
  end {
    # Add new values if needed
    # ...
  }
}
```

Note: The `end` field contains a new value for each iteration of the loop. If you want to remove this line, simply replace it with `end {
  # Remove the output statement from the markdown code block
}`.
