The YAML data looks correct. The `beginning` and `ending` values are optional, but they have been provided in the `beginning`, `ending`, and `synopsis` values for each template section.
Here's an example output in Markdown format:
```yaml
# Game

game:
  beginning: the beginning of the game
  ending: the ending of the game
  synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: game title
```

And here's an example output in YAML format with the `beginning`, `ending`, and `synopsis` values for each template section:
```yaml
# Game

game:
  beginning: the beginning of the game
  ending: the ending of the game
  synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: game title
  beginning: the beginning of the game
