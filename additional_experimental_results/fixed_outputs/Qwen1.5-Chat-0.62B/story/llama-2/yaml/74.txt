The `beginning` and `ending` tokens should be properly punctuated and separated by a comma. The `Synopsis` token should also be properly punctuated and separated by a comma.
Here's the corrected YAML data:
```
game:
  beginning: the beginning of the game
  ending: the end of the game
  synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: game title
```
