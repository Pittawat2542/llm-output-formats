The correct YAML data is provided between ```yaml and ```. The original message is provided between ```yaml and ```. Here's the corrected YAML:
```yaml
game:
  beginning: the beginning of the game
  ending: the ending of the game
  synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: game title
```

Here's how the code works:
- The input data is provided between two YAML tags.
- The output data is the corrected YAML data.
- The Markdown code block is embedded within the YAML document to provide a complete example.
