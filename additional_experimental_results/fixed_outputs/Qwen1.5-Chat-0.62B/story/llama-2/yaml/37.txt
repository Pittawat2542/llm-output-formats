The code has been corrected to fix the syntax and provide new values if needed. If there is nothing wrong, only return the correct YAML data in a code block (between ```yaml and ```). The original message is provided between ```yaml and ```. Here's the corrected code:
```yaml
game:
  beginning: the beginning of the game
  ending: the ending of the game
  synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: game title
```
The output format is now YAML and includes the correct content. The example provided in the question is also in YAML format, which is included in the Markdown code block.
