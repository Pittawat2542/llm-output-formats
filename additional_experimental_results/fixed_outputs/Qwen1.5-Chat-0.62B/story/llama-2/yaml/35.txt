The YAML data provided is correct. It contains a single `game` object with several properties and methods that describe the game itself.
Here's an example code block in Markdown format that outputs the YAML:
```
game:
beginning: the beginning of the game
ending: the ending of the game
synopsis: game story synopsis
title: game title
```

The output will be:
```
beginning: the beginning of the game
ending: the ending of the game
synopsis: game story synopsis
title: game title
```
