The issue with the YAML data is that there is an incorrect syntax. The correct syntax for a YAML file is `data => { ... }`, where `data` is the key and `{}` is the value to be stored in the `data` field.

Here's the corrected YAML data:

```yaml
game:
  beginning: the beginning of the game
  ending: the ending of the game
  synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: game title
```

The Markdown code block will look like this:

```yaml
game:
beginning:
the beginning of the game
ending:
the ending of the game
synopsis:
game story synopsis
title:
game title
```

And here's the Markdown code block with new values added to each field:

```yaml
game:
beginning:
the beginning of the game
ending:
the ending of the game
synopsis:
game story synopsis
title:
game title
beginning:
the beginning of the game
end:
the ending of the game
```

Now, when you run the code with the `yaml` input format, it will output:

```yaml
game:
beginning: the beginning of the game
ending: the ending of the game
synopsis: game story synopsis
title: game title
beginning:
the beginning of the game
end:
the ending of the game
```

And here's the Markdown code block with the new values added to each field:

```yaml
game:
beginning:
the beginning of the game
ending:
the ending of the game
synopsis:
game story synopsis
title: game title
beginning:
the beginning of the game
end:
the ending of the game
beginning:
the beginning of the game
end:
the ending of the game
```

The output is now correct and produces the expected YAML format.
