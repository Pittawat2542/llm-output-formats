Here's the corrected YAML data:
```yaml
game:
  title: "The Game"
  synopsis: "The game is about a boy who has to save the world from an evil enemy."
  beginning: "The game begins with the boy waking up in his bedroom." 
```
Note that I made the following changes:

  * I changed the `beginning` to `beginning`, because it already exists.
  * I removed the extra space at the end of the `end` block, because it's unnecessary.

The updated YAML file is now:
```yaml
game:
  title: "The Game"
  synopsis: "The game is about a boy who has to save the world from an evil enemy."
  beginning: "The game begins with the boy waking up in his bedroom." 
```
Output in Markdown code block format:
