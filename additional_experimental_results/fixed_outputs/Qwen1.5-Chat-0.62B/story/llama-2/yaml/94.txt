The correct syntax for the YAML data is:

```yaml
game:
  beginning: the beginning of the game
  ending: the ending of the game
  synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: game title
```

Here are new values if needed:

- `beginning`: the beginning of the game
- `ending`: the end of the game
- `synopsis`: game story synopsis
- `title`: game title

The output in YAML format is:
```yaml
game:
  begining: the beginning of the game
  ending: the end of the game
  synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: game title
```

And here are new Markdown code blocks that display the output in YAML format and include the correct syntax:

```markdown
