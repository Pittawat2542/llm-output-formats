Sure, here's the corrected XML data:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>the ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```

And here's an example of how you can use this corrected XML data in a Markdown code block:
```markdown
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>the ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```

This code will generate an Markdown file that shows how to use the `game` element in a Python program.
