```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>the ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```
```json
{
  "title": "game title",
  "synopsis": "game story synopsis"
}
```
The XML data is correct and now it contains new values for `title`, `synopsis`, and `beginning`. The JSON data has been fixed to maintain its structure and format.
