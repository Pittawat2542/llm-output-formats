```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?> 
<game>
	<title>The title</title>
	< synopsis>A summary about the game</synopsis>
	<beginning>The beginning of the game...</beginning>
	<ending>The end of the game.</ending>
</game>

```
The correct syntax is to use double quotes around elements within curly braces. The new values for `title`, `synopsis`, and `beginning` are as follows:

- `<title>`: The title element
- `< synopsis>`: A summary about the game element
- `<beginning>`: The beginning of the game element

The output in Markdown format is:

<?xml version="1.0"?> 
<game>
	<title>The title</title>
	< synopsis>A summary about the game</synopsis>
	<beginning>The beginning of the game...</beginning>
	<ending>The end of the game.</ending>
</game>

```

This code uses double quotes around elements within curly braces.
