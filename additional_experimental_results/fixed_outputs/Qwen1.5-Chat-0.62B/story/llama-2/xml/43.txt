The correct syntax for the given XML data is as follows:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>the ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```

The new values needed to make it correct are `synopsis` and `ending`. The new line after `beginning` should be changed to `endings`, because it is a comment that tells the parser what the end of the game is supposed to be. The `endings` should now be in the beginning of the XML string, so that the parser can continue its processing.
