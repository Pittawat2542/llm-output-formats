Here is an example of how to fix the incorrect XML data:

```
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>the ending of the game</ending> 
</game>

## Error: incorrect_syntax: not well-formed (invalid token): line 2, column 1
Template: 
```

In this example, we are using a syntax error in line 2 of the code. The `not well-formed` token is indicating that there is an invalid character in the line, but it does not cause any errors because the line has been properly written and parsed. This can be fixed by adding more checks to identify and fix the issue before running the code.

```
