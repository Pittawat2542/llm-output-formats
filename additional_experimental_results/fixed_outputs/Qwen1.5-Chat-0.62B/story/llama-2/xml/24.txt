The XML data provided is correct. It has been corrected for syntax and values as needed. The output in Markdown format is as follows:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>the ending of the game</ending> 
</game>
```
The output in Markdown format is not properly formatted due to the missing closing curly braces. The correct code block would be:
```markdown
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
```
