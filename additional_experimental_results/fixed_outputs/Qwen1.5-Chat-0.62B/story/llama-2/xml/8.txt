The XML data is correct and there is nothing wrong. Here's the corrected code:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>The game title</title>
	<synopsis>The game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>The beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>The ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```

Output in Markdown format:

```xml
## Game Title

## Game Story synopsis

## Begining

## Endings
