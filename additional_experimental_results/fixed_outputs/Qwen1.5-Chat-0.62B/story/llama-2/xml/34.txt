The correct syntax for this XML data is:
```
<?xml version="1.0"?> <game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>the ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```

And here is the corrected code block:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?> <game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>the ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```

Note that I have added a closing tag to the `<game>` element and changed the value of the `<title>` attribute to match the correct syntax.
