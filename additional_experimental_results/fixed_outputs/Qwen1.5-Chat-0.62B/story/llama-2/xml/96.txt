The correct syntax for the XML data is as follows:

```xml
<game>
  <title>game title</title>
  <synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
  <beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
  <ending>the ending of the game</ending> 
</game>
```
Here, `<game>` is a tag that represents the root element for the XML data. The `<title>` tag is used to represent the title of the game, `<synopsis>` tag is used to represent the synopsis of the game and `<beginning>` tag is used to represent the beginning of the game, `<ending>` tag is used to represent the ending of the game.
