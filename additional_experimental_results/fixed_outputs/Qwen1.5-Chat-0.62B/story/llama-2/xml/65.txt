Here's an updated code block with the correct syntax:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>the end of the game</ending>
</game>
```

The code block now follows the correct syntax for XML data and correctly provides new values if needed. If there is nothing wrong, only return the XML in a code block (between ```xml and ```). The original message is provided between ```xml and ```. Return output in XML format and only the XML in the Markdown code block.
