The code block provided does not contain any syntax errors or mistakes. It is a simple example of an XML document that contains a `<game>` element with some child elements such as `<title>` and `<synopsis>`.

Here is the corrected version of the code:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?> 
<game>
	<title>The game title is the game title.</title>
	_synopsis>The game synopsis is the game synopsis.</synopsis>
	beginning>The beginning of the game is the beginning of the game.</beginning>
	ending>The ending of the game is the ending of the game.</ending>
</game>
```
In this example, the `<title>` and `<synopsis>` elements have been correctly added to the `<game>` element. The `<beginning>` and `<ending>` elements are also correct in their placement within the `<game>` element.

The code block is now complete and can be used as needed.
