The incorrect syntax in the XML data is not well-formed and requires a valid token to be properly identified. In the given example, there is no token provided for the `synopsis` field, so it should be an optional element with a name or a value of "synopsis". Additionally, there is a missing closing tag for the `beginning` section.

The correct syntax and values for the XML data are:
```xml
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	_synopsis="game story synopsis"
	.beginning="the beginning of the game"
	ending="the ending of the game"
</game>
```

This code will create an XML document with the following content:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	_synopsis="game story synopsis"
	.beginning="the beginning of the game"
	ending="the ending of the game"
</game>
```

The modified code will correctly output the XML data in Markdown format and only include the values for `synopsis`, `beginning`, and `ending`.
