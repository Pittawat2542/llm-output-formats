The error in the original XML data is that it does not have a `title` or `synopsis` element. The correct syntax for a `game` element includes both elements, and they are separated by commas.
Here's an updated version of the XML code with the corrected syntax:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>the ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```
This version uses a single `<>` and two `</>` tags to separate the `title` and `synopsis` elements, and it correctly includes them in the `game` element.
