The correct YAML data for your template is:

```
[game]
beginning: I wake up in my bed, feeling drowsy and unsure what I did last night. Someone must have hit me on the head.
ending: As I come to my senses, I realize the events of the previous night. I have a massive headache and decide to search my memory for clues.
```

Here's the updated YAML code block:
```yaml
[game]  
beginning: I wake up in my bed, feeling drowsy and unsure what I did last night. Someone must have hit me on the head.  
ending: As I come to my senses, I realize the events of the previous night. I have a massive headache and decide to search my memory for clues.
```

Note that the `beginning` and `ending` placeholders in your original YAML data are correct and should be replaced with the actual values for your template.
