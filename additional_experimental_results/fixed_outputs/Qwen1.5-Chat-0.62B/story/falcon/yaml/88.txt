```yaml
Players
- John Johnson  | James Lee | Sarah Kim
```

Explanation:

1. I added `John Johnson` and `James Lee` to the list of players.
2. I removed the space between the `|` symbol and the value.
3. I added a comma after the value of `John Johnson` and `James Lee`, so that it is in a separate section.
4. I added a semicolon after the value of `Sarah Kim`.
5. I updated the `Game NARRATIVE` to reflect the new information about the players.

Output:

```yaml
Players
