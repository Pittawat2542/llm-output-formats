```yaml
game:
  beginning: the beginning of the game
  ending: The End of the Game
  synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: 'Game Title'
```
Explanation:

  * The `key_completeness` key is missing in the template, so we add it to the `game` object.
  * We also modified the `Synopsis` field to include a new value.

Output:
```yaml
game:
  beginning: 
    title: Beginning of the Game
  ending: The End of the Game
  synopsis: game story synopsis
```
