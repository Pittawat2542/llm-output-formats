```json
{
    "game": {
        "title": "game title",
        "synopsis": "game story synopsis",
        "beginning": "the beginning of the game",
        "ending": "the end of the game",
        "characters": [
            {
                "name": "player1"
            },
            {
                "name": "player2"
            }
        ],
        "装备": ["gaming keyboard", "gaming mouse"]
    }
}
```
Here's the output in JSON format:
```json
{
    "game": {
        "title": "game title",
        "synopsis": "game story synopsis",
        "beginning": "the beginning of the game",
        "ending": "the end of the game",
        "characters": [
            {
                "name": "player1"
            },
            {
                "name": "player2"
            }
        ],
        "装备": ["gaming keyboard", "gaming mouse"]
    }
}
```
The new values in the JSON are:

- `characters`: an array of objects, where each object represents a player and their gear.
- `装备`: an array of objects, where each object represents a gaming device.

Note that there were no syntax errors in the original JSON data.
