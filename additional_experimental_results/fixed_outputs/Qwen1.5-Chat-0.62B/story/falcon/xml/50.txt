The correct XML data is provided between the two elements. Here's an example of how to use it:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>the ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```

To fix the syntax, we need to add a closing parenthesis after the `<>` tag in the `synopsis` element. Here's the corrected code:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>Synopsis for game</synopsis>
	<beginning>
		<!-- Add your start and end elements here -->
	</beginning>
	<ending>
		<!-- Add your end element here -->
	</ending>
</game>
```

To provide new values if needed, we can add more information about the game. For example:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>Synopsis for game</synopsis>
	<beginning>
		<p>Game Title: A new video game with a storyline that takes place in the future.</p>
	</beginning>
	<ending>
		<p>Game Title: The end of the world and the survivors who must find a way to survive it.</p>
	</ending>
</game>
```

To return output in Markdown code block, we can add backticks around the `<` tags that indicate the start and end elements. Here's an example:
```python
