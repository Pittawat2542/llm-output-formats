```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	BEGINING "the beginning of the game"
	 ENDING "the ending of the game"
</game>
```

The correct syntax for this XML data is as follows:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	BEGINING "the beginning of the game"
	 ENDING "the ending of the game"
</game>
```

Here are new values that need to be provided if needed:

- `<synopsis>`: "game story synopsis"
- `<beginning>`: "the beginning of the game"
- `<ending>`: "the ending of the game"

The original message is provided between ```xml and ```.
