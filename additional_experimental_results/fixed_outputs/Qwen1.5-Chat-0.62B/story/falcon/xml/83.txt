The correct XML data is provided in the code block below:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>the ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```
Here, we have corrected the syntax and provided new values if needed. If there is nothing wrong, only return the XML in a code block (between ```xml and ```). The original message is provided between ```xml and ```.
