The corrected XML data is:
```
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>
		The beginning of the game.
	</ending>
	<ending>The end of the game.</ending>
</game>
```

Output in Markdown format:
```xml
* **synopsis**: game story synopsis
```

Note: The syntax of the original code was incorrect, and the missing `<?` character is included to complete the XML declaration. Additionally, the line number for the "beginning" element is incorrect, which should be the first occurrence in the "synopsis" section.
