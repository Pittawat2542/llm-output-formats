Here is the corrected XML data:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE game>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>game title</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>game title</h1>
		<h2>Synopsis</h2>
		<p>The game story synopsis goes as follows:</p>
		<p>It is a dark and rainy night. You enter a mysterious mansion on a hill, filled with hauntingly beautiful ghosts that have been wandering the halls for centuries.</p>

		<a href="ending.html">Go to ending of the game</a>
	</body>
</html>
```

The syntax was incorrect and did not follow the XML standard. The `<h1>` tag should be at the beginning of the content, while the `<h2>` tag should be at the end of the content. Additionally, the `<p>` tag should be placed at the beginning of the content to begin the game story synopsis. I have also provided the new values for `h1`, `h2`, and `p` as needed.
