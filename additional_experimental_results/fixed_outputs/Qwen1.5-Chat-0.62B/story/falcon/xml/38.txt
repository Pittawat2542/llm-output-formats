Explanation:

1. I fixed the syntax error in line 2, column 0 by adding a semicolon to close the square bracket and change the sentence structure to correct the order of the items.

2. I added new values for "beginning" and "ending" to match the actual content of the XML code block, which is now correctly formatted.
