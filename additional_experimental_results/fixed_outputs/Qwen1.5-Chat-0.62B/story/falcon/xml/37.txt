```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?> 
<game>
    <title>game title</title>
    
    <!-- Add the game story synopsis here -->
</game>
```
Note that you can add more content to the `game` tag as needed for your application. The Markdown code block is now separate from the game content, and the XML output will look like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?> 
<game>
    <title>game title</title>
    
    <!-- Add the game story synopsis here -->
    <story>
        <game story synopsis>
            <summary>game story summary</summary>
        </game story synopsis>
    </story>
</game>
```
In this example, you can add more information about the game in the `story` tag as needed for your application.
