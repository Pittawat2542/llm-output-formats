```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>  
<game>
	<title>Quest Title</title>
	 Objective: Quest Objective
	 Description: Quest Description
	 Reward: Quest Reward
	 Giver: Quest Giver
	 Tasks:
		<task id="quest-id"> 
			Order: Task Order <Objective> Task Objective <Description>Task Description <Location> Task Location</Location> 
		</task>
	</game>
```
The syntax in the original code is incorrect and needs to be corrected. The `任务` element should have a `id` attribute, not an `id` attribute with a value of `quest-id`. Additionally, the `objective` element should use a single string instead of multiple strings. 
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>  
<game>
	<title>Quest Title</title>
	 Objective: Quest Objective
	 Description: Quest Description
	 Reward: Quest Reward
	 Giver: Quest Giver
	 Tasks:
		<task id="quest-id"> 
			Order: Task Order <Objective> Task Objective <Description>Task Description <Location> Task Location</Location> 
			<objective>
				<string>Quest Objective 1</string> <string>Quest Objective 2</string> 
			</ objective>
		</task>
	</game>
```
The `objective` element now has a single string value of the desired objectives.
