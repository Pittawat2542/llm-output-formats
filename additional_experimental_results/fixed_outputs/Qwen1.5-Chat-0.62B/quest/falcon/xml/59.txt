Here's the corrected XML data:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<id>quest_id</id>
	<title>quest title</title>
	 objective: quest objective
	description: quest description
	 reward: quest reward
	quest-giver:quest giver
	tasks:
	- task: task_id
    	- task_id
	</game>
```

The syntax has been corrected to match the structure and content of the XML data. The new values have also been added if needed.
Output in Markdown format:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>Quest Title</title>
	 Objective: Quest Objective
	 Description: Quest Description
	 Reward: Quest Reward
	 Quest-Giver: Quest Giver
	 Tasks:
	- Task: Task ID
     - Task: Task ID
</game>
```
