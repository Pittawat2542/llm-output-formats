The correct XML data is as follows:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0""?>
<game>
	<id>id</id>
	<title>quest title</title>
	 objective>quest objective</objective>
	 description>quest description</description>
	 reward>quest reward</reward>
	Quest-giver> Quest giver</Quest-giver>
	Tasks
	<!--Add new tasks elements here.--> <task>
	<order>task order</order>
	 Objective>task objective</Objective>
	 Description>task description</Description>
	 Location>task location</Location>
	</tasks>
</game>
```
