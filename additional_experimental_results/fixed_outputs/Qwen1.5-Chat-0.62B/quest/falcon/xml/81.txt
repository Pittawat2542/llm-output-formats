Sure, here is the corrected XML data:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>Quest Title</title>
	 Objective: Quest Objective</Objective>
	 Description: Quest Description
	 Reward: Quest Reward
	 Giver: Quest Giver
	 Tasks:
	 <task>
			Order: Task Order
		 Objective: Task Objective
			Description: Task Description
		 Location: Task Location
	 </task>
</tasks>

```
And here is the Markdown code block that displays the corrected XML data:
```markdown
# Quest Info
id: id
title: quest title
objective: quest objective
description: quest description
reward: quest reward
giver: quest-giver
tasks: <task>
	Order: Task Order
	Objective: Task Objective
		Description: Task Description
	Location: Task Location
</task>
```
