The provided XML data appears to be correct. Here's an example of how you can modify it to add a new line with the objective:
```xml
@quests
{
  @objective {
    <description>Quest description</description>
  }
}
```

Now, the modified XML code block looks like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<id>id</id>
	<title>quest title</title>
	 Objective: Quest objective
	 Description: Quest description
	 Reward: Quest reward
	 Quest-giver: Quest giver
	 Tasks:
      <task>
        <order>task order</order>
        Objective: Objective
        Description: Description
        Location: Task location
      </task>
  }
</game>
```

When you run the modified XML file, it will print out a list of all the quest objects that are included in the game.
