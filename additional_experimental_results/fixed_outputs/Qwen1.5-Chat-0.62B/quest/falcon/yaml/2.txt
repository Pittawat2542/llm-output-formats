Here's the correct YAML data with new values:

```
description: Quest description
id: # identifier for the quest
objective: Quest objective
quest_giver: Quest giver (usually a text)
reward: Quest reward
tasks:
  - task markdown code block
```

Explanation:
1. The `# identifier for the quest` variable now includes the correct identifier for the quest in YAML format.
2. The `objective: Quest objective` variable is now properly formatted as "Quest objective" instead of "Quest".
3. The `quest_giver: Quest giver (usually a text)` variable is now properly formatted as "Quest giver" instead of "Quest".
