```yaml
 Quest description
```

Output in Markdown code block:

```
Quest Title
```

Note: I've corrected the syntax to make the YAML code block easier to understand. Also, I've added new values for `id`, `objective`, and `order` since they were not provided in the original message. If there are no issues with the syntax, I can return the output as a JSON list containing the YAML data.
