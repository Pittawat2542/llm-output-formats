Here is the corrected YAML data:
```
# Output format
title: Quest Title
description: Quest Description
objective: Quest Objective
giver: Quest Giver
giver_id: Quest Giver ID
xplore_location: Location
giver_location: Location
```

The correct syntax in the YAML is:

```yaml
game:
  description: Quest Description
  id: id
  objective: Quest Objective
  quest_giver: Quest Giver
  reward: Quest Reward
  tasks:
   - description: Task Description
    location: Task Location
    objective: Task Objective
    order: Task Order
```

If there is nothing wrong, only return the YAML in a code block (between ```yaml and ```). The original message is provided between ```yaml and ```. Return output in YAML format and only the YAML in the Markdown code block. YAML.
