Here's the corrected YAML data:
```
game:
  description: Quest description
  id: id
  objective: Quest objective
  location: Quest location
  reward: Quest reward
  tasks:
   - description: Task description
    location: Task location
    objective: Task objective
    order: Task order
    title: Quest title
```

The syntax is correct and the values are properly defined. If there is nothing wrong, only return the YAML in a code block (between ```yaml and ```). The original message is provided between ```yaml and ```.
