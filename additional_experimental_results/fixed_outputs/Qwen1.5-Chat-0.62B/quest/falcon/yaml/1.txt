```yaml
game.id = "id"
game.objective = "quest objective"
game.qust_giver = "quest giver"
game奖励 = "quest reward"
game.tasks.type.0 = "task0 location, optional:"
```

Explanation:
- The `i` is used to represent Unicode values for "id" and "objective", which are not allowed in YAML.
- The `^` character indicates that the value should be a literal string instead of a mapping.
- The correct syntax was used in line 5, column 52.
