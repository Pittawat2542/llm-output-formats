<?php

$game = new \PHPExcel\Reader();
$x = $game->read(" quests.xml");
foreach ($x as $task) {
    echo "<div>";
    echo "<h2><p>" . $task["title"] . "</p></h2>";
    echo "<ul>";
    foreach ($task as $objective) {
        echo "<li><a href=\"quest giver\" title=\"Quest giver\" class=\"objective\">Objective</a> <br>";
        echo "<a href=\"quest-giver\" title=\" Quest giver\" class=\"giver\" >Giver</a> <br>";
        echo "</li>";
    }
    echo "</ul>";
}
?>
```

The code block above uses PHPExcel to read an XML file and create a list of tasks. Each task is represented as a `<ul>` element with two `<h2>` elements for the title and the objective, respectively. The tasks are presented in an unordered list with each task having a link that leads to the Quest giver or Quest giver's location.
The output will be:

```
Quest to complete is to go to a castle somewhere in the mountains, Obtain an ancient tome, and return it to the quest giver. You will need to be a high level to complete this quest.
This quest can be finished at any time after you receive it. The quest giver will not wait forever.
The quest giver is not far from the castle but you will need horses.
The reward for completing this quest will be one hundred gold pieces.
This quest is part of a larger overarching story, so quests are usually
related. If you like doing quests, be sure to check them all out!
Your quest log, which keeps track of all of the quests you have received and completed, is in your personal inventory.
