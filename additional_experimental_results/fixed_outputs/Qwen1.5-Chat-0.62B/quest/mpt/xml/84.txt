```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>Quest Title</title>
	 objective = "Quest Objective"
	 description = "Quest Description"
	 reward = 1
	 quest_giver = "Quest Giver"
	 tasks = [
			{
			_order: "Task Order",
			 objective: "Objectives",
			 description: "Description",
			 location: "Location",
			},
		]
	</game>
```
The ` Quest_giver` and `tasks` elements have been modified to match the new structure. The `Quest_value` element has also been added to reflect the value of the `quest-giver` and `tasks` elements respectively.
Here is the updated code block:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>Quest Title</title>
	 objective = "Quest Objective"
	 description = " Quest Description"
	 reward = 1
	 quest_giver = "Quest Giver"
	 tasks = [
			{
			_order: "Task Order",
			 objective: "Objectives",
			 description: "Description",
			 location: "Location",
			},
		],
		quest_value = {
			giver: "Quest Giver",
		(tasks: [ {order: "Order", objective, description, location} ] },
	</game>
```
