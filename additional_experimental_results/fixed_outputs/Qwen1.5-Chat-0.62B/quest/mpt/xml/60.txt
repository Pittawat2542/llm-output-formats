	<objective>Acquire three ancient artifacts</objective>
	<description>You have just received a letter from your grandfather
	stating that he has located the location of an artifact that has been
	lost for more than 300 years. As a young man he and his friends
(discovered this incredible item. Now much older and on his deathbed, he
	xanded to you to search for the object to prove once and for all that it really
	exists. The artifact is a magical staff that grants the user great power
	over time and space. There are three locations around the world where
	The staff was supposedly left. Your grandfather has only been able
	to identify two of these locations. With the help of your friends, 
	you will need to find all three objects if you are ever to understand
 why your grandfather kept this secret for so many years. There is, 
	unfortunately, a great evil that seeks the staff and has traveled
through time to search for it as well. This ancient evil has already
	sent one of their spies back to the present day with the goal of stealing
	The staff. You will have to act quickly if you want to find all three
