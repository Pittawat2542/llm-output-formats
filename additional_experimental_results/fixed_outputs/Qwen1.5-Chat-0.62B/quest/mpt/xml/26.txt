Explanation:

* The `<id>` tag is missing in the original XML code and needs to be added.
* The `<title>` tag should also be added.
* The `<objective>` tag should have an attribute named "Objective" with a value of "Quest objective".
* The `<description>` tag should have a value of "Quest description".
