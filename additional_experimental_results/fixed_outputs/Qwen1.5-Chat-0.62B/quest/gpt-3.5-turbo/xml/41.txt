The `<id>` tag has been removed since it is no longer needed. The `<title>` tag now contains the actual title of the game. The `objective` tag specifies the objective that the player will face, and the `description` tag provides a summary of the objective. The `reward` tag represents the reward that the player can claim when they complete the objectives.
The `quest-giver` tag is now replaced with the `quest-giver` variable which stores the name of the quest giver. The `tasks` tag has been added to provide a list of tasks that the player will have to complete in order to achieve the objectives.
The corrected code block looks like this:
