The `objective` attribute was added to the `quest-giver` element to specify the objective of the quest. The ` reward` attribute has been updated to include a value of 500 gold and the Mystic Sword, which are important to the quest. Finally, the `tasks` element contains two tasks: one requiring the player to defeat guards at the Soulless Castle entrance and another finding a sorcerer's hideout.
