In this code, I have added new values such as `order` and `objective`, which are used to specify the order in which the tasks must be completed. The `order` value can be either 1 or 2, depending on whether the task needs to be reached or completed first.
The `objective` value can also be either " Reach the village" or " Fight the beast." In this case, I have set the `order` value to "Reach the village," which will allow the player to complete their quest.
