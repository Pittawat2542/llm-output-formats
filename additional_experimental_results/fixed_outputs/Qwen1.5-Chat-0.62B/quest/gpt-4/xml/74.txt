Explanation:
- Added `<description>` and `<location>` attributes to the `<quest-giver>` attribute to indicate that it is the quest giver.
- Added `<order>` and `<location>` attributes to the `<tasks>` attribute to indicate that they are the task tasks.
- Fixed the syntax error in the `< reward>` attribute by adding the correct value for the key 'quest-giver' after the ` Quest-Giver` attribute.
