Here's the corrected YAML data with new values:
```
game:

  id: 1
  objective: "Kill the dragon"
  quest_giver: "The king"
  reward: "Gold"
  tasks:
   - description: " Kill the dragon"
    location: "The forest"
    objective: "Kill the dragon"
    order: 1
   - description: "Find the dragon"
    location: "The cave"
    objective: "Find the dragon"
    order: 2
   - description: "Talk to the dragon"
    location: "The mountain"
    objective: "Talk to the dragon"
    order: 3
  title: "Dragon slayer" # Added 'title'
```
