The code looks correct. Here is the output in YAML format:
```yaml
game:
  description: Quest Description
  id: 1
  objective: Quest Objective
  quest_giver: Quest giver
  reward: Quest reward
  tasks:
    - description: Task Description
      location: Task Location
      objective: Task objective
      order: Order
    - description: Task Description
      location: Task Location
      objective: Task objective
      order: Order
    - description: Task Description
      location: Task Location
      objective: Task objective
      order: Order
  title: Quest Title
```

Note that I added a new value for the `quest_giver` field to provide the information about the quest giver. The remaining tasks are just the same as before, with the same descriptions and objectives.
