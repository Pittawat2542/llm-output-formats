The issue with the YAML data is that it does not have a `description` field. To fix this, we need to add a `description` field in the YAML data.

Here's the corrected code:

```yaml
game:
  description: Quest description
  id: id
  objective: Quest objective
  quest_giver: Quest giver
  reward: Quest reward
  tasks:
    - description: Task description
      location: Task location
      objective: Task objective
      order: Task order
      title: Quest title
```

This code now has a `description` field and sets the values for the `id`, `objective`, `quest_giver`, `reward`, and `tasks` fields.
