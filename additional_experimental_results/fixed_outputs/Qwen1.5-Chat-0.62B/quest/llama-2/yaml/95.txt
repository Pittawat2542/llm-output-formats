The issue with the YAML data is that it contains a missing key-value pair in the `objective` field. The correct value should be `quest_giver`, so the updated YAML would look like this:
```
game:
  description: quest description
  id: id
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
   - description: task description
    location: task location
    objective: quest objective
    order: task order
  title: quest title
```
The Markdown code block for the output is as follows:
```yaml
**Quest Giver** < Quest Giver>
* * Quest Giver ID*
```
