The YAML code has no syntax errors, and there are no new values needed. The original message is provided between ```yaml and ```.

Here's the corrected code:
```
game:
  description: Quest description
  id: id
  objective: Quest objective
  quest_giver: Quest giver
  reward: Quest reward
  tasks:
   - description: Task description
    location: Task location
    objective: Task objective
    order: Task order
  title: Quest title
```

Output in YAML format and only the YAML in the Markdown code block.
