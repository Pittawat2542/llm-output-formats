The given YAML data does not have any syntax errors. It appears to be correct and should work as expected.
Here is the code block in Markdown format with the corrected YAML data:
```yaml
game:
  description: quest description
  id: id
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
    - description: task description
      location: task location
      objective: task objective
      order: task order
    - description: task description
      location: task location
      objective: task objective
      order: task order
  title: quest title
```

The only issue is the syntax in line 7, where it should be `-description`, not `-description`. It needs to be changed to `-task description` in that line.
Here are the corrected lines:
```yaml
game:
  description: quest description
  id: id
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
    - task description:
      location: task location
      objective: task objective
      order: task order
    - task description:
      location: task location
      objective: task objective
      order: task order
```
