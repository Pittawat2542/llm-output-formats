The YAML data is correct and does not contain any errors. Here's an example of how to use it:

```yaml
game:
  description: "A quest to find the lost sword"
  id: 1
  objective: "Find the lost sword"
  quest_giver: "King"
  reward: "Gold"

# Example usage

- description: "A quest to find the lost sword"
  id: 2
  objective: "Find the lost sword"
  quest_giver: "King"
  reward: "Gold"

# Example usage

- description: "A quest to find the lost sword"
  id: 3
  objective: "Find the lost sword"
  quest_giver: "King"
  reward: "Gold"

# Example usage

- description: "A quest to find the lost sword"
  id: 4
  objective: "Find the lost sword"
  quest_giver: "King"
  reward: " Gold"

# Example usage

- description: "A quest to find the lost sword"
  id: 5
  objective: "Find the lost sword"
  quest_giver: "King"
  reward: "Gold"

# Example usage

- description: "A quest to find the lost sword"
  id: 6
  objective: "Find the lost sword"
  quest_giver: "King"
  reward: "Gold"

# Example usage

- description: "A quest to find the lost sword"
  id: 7
  objective: "Find the lost sword"
  quest_giver: "King"
  reward: "Gold"

# Example usage

- description: "A quest to find the lost sword"
  id: 8
  objective: "Find the lost sword"
  quest_giver: "King"
  reward: "Gold"
```

Note that in this example, we've added two new `id` and `objective` properties to the game object. This will be used to provide unique names for different Quests and objectives within the game world.
