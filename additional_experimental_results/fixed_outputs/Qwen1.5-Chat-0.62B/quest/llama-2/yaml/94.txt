To fix the YAML data, you can add `^` before ````, which is the start of a new line. Here's the corrected version:
```yaml
game:
  description: Quest description
  id: 1
  objective: Quest objective
  quest_giver: Quest giver
  reward: Quest reward
  tasks:
   - description: Task description
    location: Task location
    objective: Task objective
    order: 1
  title: Quest title
```
This will fix the syntax and provide new values if needed. If there is nothing wrong, only return the YAML in a code block (between ```yaml and ```).
