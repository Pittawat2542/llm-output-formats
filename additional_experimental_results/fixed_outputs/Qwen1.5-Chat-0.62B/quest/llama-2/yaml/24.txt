The YAML data is correct and the code block accordingly. Here's the output in YAML format:
```yaml
## Example
game:
  description: Quest description
  id: 123
  objective: Quest objective
  quest_giver: Quest giver
  reward: Quest reward
  tasks:
     - description: Task description
      location: Task location
      objective: Task objective
      order: Task order
     - description: Task description
      location: Task location
      objective: Task objective
      order: Task order
    title: Quest title
```

If there is anything wrong with the YAML data, please let me know and I'll do my best to fix it.
