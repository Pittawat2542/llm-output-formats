The issue with the XML data is that it contains invalid tokens, such as `</任务>` and `<objective>`. These tokens must be replaced by their correct values.
Here's the corrected code:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<id>id</id>
	<title>quest title</title>
	<objective>quest objective</objective>
	<description>quest description</description>
	<reward>quest reward</reward>
	<Quest-giver>quest giver</ Quest-giver>
	<Tasks>
		<li><order>task order</order></li>
		<li><objective>任务 objective</objective></li>
		<li><description>任务 description</description></li>
		<li><location>task location</location></li>
		<li><action>quest action</action></li>
	</Tasks>
</game>
```
The `<task>` tag is missing the opening `<` and closing `<]`. The `<order>` and `<objective>` tags are also missing their proper opening and closing brackets.
The `<description>` tag should also be in its correct position. Finally, the `<location>` tag should have a single opening `<]`, and the `<action>` tag should have two opening `<]`.
Output:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<id>id</id>
	<title>quest title</title>
	<objective>quest objective</objective>
	<description>quest description</description>
	<reward>quest reward</reward>
	<Quest-giver>quest giver</ Quest-giver>
	<Tasks>
		<li><order>task order</order></li>
		<li><objective>任务 Objective</objective></li>
		<li><description>任务描述</description></li>
		<li><location>task location</location></li>
		<li><action>quest action</action></li>
	</Tasks>
</game>
```
In the output, the correct XML data is displayed in a code block between the `<?xml` and `]]>` tags. The code blocks are separated by semicolons to separate them from each other.
