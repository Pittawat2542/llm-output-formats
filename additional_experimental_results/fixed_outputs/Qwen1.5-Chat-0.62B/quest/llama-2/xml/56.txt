The provided XML data is not well-formed (invalid token: line 2, column 1). There are several issues that need to be addressed to fix the syntax:

  1. Make sure the `</>` tag is properly closed.
  2. Make sure that the `<objectives>` tag is properly nested within the `<tasks>` tag.
  3. Add a `<description>` tag after the `<objective>` tag to provide more information about the quest.

Here's an updated version with these issues fixed:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<id>id</id>
	<title>Quest title</title>
	<objective>quest objective</objective>
	<description>Quest description</description>
	<reward>quest reward</reward>
	<tasks>
		<task id="task-1">
			<objectives>
				<objectives>
					<objective>
						<title="Objective 1">Quest objective 1</title>
					</objective>
				</objectives>
			</objectives>
			<description>Quest description for task 1.</description>
		</task>
		<task id="task-2">
			<objectives>
				<objectives>
					<objective>
						<title="Objective 2">Quest objective 2</title>
					</objective>
				</objectives>
			</objectives>
			<description>Quest description for task 2.</description>
		</task>
		<task id="task-3">
			<objectives>
				<objectives>
					<objective>
						<title="Objective 3">Quest objective 3</title>
					</objective>
				</objectives>
			</objectives>
			<description>Quest description for task 3.</description>
		</task>
	</tasks>
</game>
```

The updated XML data now contains proper syntax and provides new values if needed. If there is nothing wrong, only the XML in a code block (between ```xml and ```). The original message is provided between ```xml and ```.
