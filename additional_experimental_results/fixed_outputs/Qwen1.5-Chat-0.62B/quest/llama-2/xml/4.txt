The provided XML data is not correct. Here's a corrected version of the XML:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>The quest title</title>
	<objective>The quest objective</objective>
	<body>Quest description</body>
	<description>Quest reward</description>
</game>

## Example
```

In this example, we've added a new element called `body`, which represents the content of the game. We've also changed the name of the `objective` and `description` elements to match our original design.

We've also updated the `title` element's value to "Quest title" and the `objective` and `description` elements to match our original design.

To include a new task in the game, we can simply add it as an `<task>` element with its `order` and `objective` attributes:

```xml
<game>
	<title>The quest title</title>
	 objective="Quest objective"
	 description="Quest description"
</game>

## Example
```

In this example, we've added a new task called "Task 1" with an `order` and `objective` attribute. We can add it as an `<task>` element with its `order` and `objective` attributes:
