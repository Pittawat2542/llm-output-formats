```xml
<?xml version="1.0""?>
<game>
	<title>quest title</title>
	 Objective>quest objective</Objective>
	 Description>quest description</Description>
	 Reward>quest reward</奖励>
	 Quest-giver>Quest giver</Quest-giver>
	 Tasks:
			{ 
				Order: order, 
			 Objective: objective, 
				Description: description, 
			location: location
			}
	]
</game>
```
The syntax in the original XML was incorrect. The `#` symbol at the end of the `任务` tag should be replaced with ````json```, which is the correct syntax for JSON data.
The new values that were provided are:
- `id`: an integer
- `title`: a string
- `objective`: a string
- `description`: a string
- `reward`: a string
- `quest-giver`: a string
- `tasks`: an array of objects with the same structure as the original JSON data.
The output in Markdown format is:
```yaml
## Examples
```json
{ 
	"id": "id", 
	"title": "quest title",
	"objective": "quest objective",
	"description": "quest description",
	"reward": "quest reward",
	" Quest-giver": "Quest giver",
	"tasks": [ 
		{
				Order: order, 
			 Objective: objective, 
				Description: description, 
			location: location
			}
	]
}

```
This is the correct code for the XML data.
