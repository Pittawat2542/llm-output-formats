Now, the correct XML data with new values is as follows:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?> 
<game>
	<id>jqs35</id>
	<title>The Cursed necklace</title>
	bjective>Retrieve the Necklace of Souls from the Witch's Castle</objective>
	<description>The Witch has stolen the necklace of Souls and placed a curse on the village. You must retrieve the necklace and break the curse.</description>
	<reward>200 experience points, 50 gold, and the necklace of Souls</ reward>
	<quest-giver市长 of the village</quest-giver>
	<tasks>
			<task>
				<order>1</order>
			bjective>Travel to the Witch's Castle</objective>
			经验值>200 experience points</经验值>
				<button id="find necklace">Find necklace</button>
			<task>
				<order>2</order>
			bjective>Find the项链 of Souls</objective>
				经验值>50 gold</经验值>
				<button id="defeat Witch">Defeat Witch</button>
			<task>
				<order>3</order>
			bjective>Defeat the Witch</objective>
			经验值>100 gold</经验值>
			</task>
	</tasks>
</game>
```
Note that I added a button in the `find necklace` task to allow the player to use it.
