The following is the corrected XML data:
```xml
<game>
	<title>Quest Giver</title>
	 Objective>Retrieve Quest Giver from quest giver's location.
</game>
```

If there is nothing wrong, only return the XML in a code block (between ```xml and ```). The original message is provided between ```xml and ```. Return output in XML format and only the XML in the Markdown code block. XML.
