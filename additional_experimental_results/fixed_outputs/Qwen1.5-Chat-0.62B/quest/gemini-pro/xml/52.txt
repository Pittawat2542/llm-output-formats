New values for the ` Quest-giver`, `Tasks`, and ` Reward` elements were added to provide a more detailed description of the quest. The `Quest-giver` element was updated to include `Farmer John` instead of `Farmer John < Quest-giver>` since it's clear that the person who is responsible for finding the missing dog is also named. The `Tasks` element has been updated to include `John's Farm` as its location, which will help the player find the missing dog.
