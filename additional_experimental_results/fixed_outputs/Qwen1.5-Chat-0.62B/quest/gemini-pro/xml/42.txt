	<description>The ancient city of Atlantis has been lost for centuries, but rumors persist that it still exists somewhere beneath the waves. You have been tasked with finding Atlantis and bringing back proof of its existence. To do this, you will need to travel to the remote island of Thera, where you will find the entrance to a secret underwater tunnel that leads to Atlantis. Inside the city, you will find many ancient artifacts and treasures, but you must be careful not to awaken the guardians who protect them.</description>
