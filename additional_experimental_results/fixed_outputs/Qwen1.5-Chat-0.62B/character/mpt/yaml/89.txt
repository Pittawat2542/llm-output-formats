Here's the corrected YAML data with the required syntax:
```
game:
  character:
    age: 23
    background: "I'm an alien from planet Pteros.".
    first_name: Sam
    id: a32d0c9
    last_name: Winchester
    physical_appearance:
      - Eye Color: green
        hair_color: blonde
        height: 5' 8'
        weight: 130 lbs
    place_of_birth: Epping Forest
    role: "Assistant to the Doctor and Amy Pond"
    species: "Race of Gallifreyan"

Original:
```yaml

    first_name: Sam
    id: a32d0c9
