A 21-year-old character named 'Alice' who was raised in rural England. Her hobbies include painting and playing the guitar. 'Alice' is of English descent and has light brown hair that she often wears in a messy top knot. She wore a simple blue dress with a red polka-dot scarf, a white blouse, and a pair of small gold earrings for her portrait. Alice's father passed away when she was in her fourth year of attending art school; her mother, a farmer, took all three daughters with her and tried to provide them the best possible rural life until their adulthood. Alice was her proudestachievment, even more than making the Dean's list at university. She is a sensitive soul; the only people who have ever been able to get her to open up about her past are her mother, sisters, and long-time best friend. She likes spending her free time painting and practicing the guitar, and aspires to become an art professor one day so she can give back to her old school and continue inspiring young artists. One of her recurring dreams is to make it as a successful artist and finally be able to afford a house - something that's been made almost impossible by the mortgage crisis of 2007.
