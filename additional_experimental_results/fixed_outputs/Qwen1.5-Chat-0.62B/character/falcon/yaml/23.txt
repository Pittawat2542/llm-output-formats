The provided YAML data does not have any errors. The correct syntax for the `game` section is:
```
game:
  character:
    age: exact age or description
    background: background story
    first_name: first name
    id: id
    last_name: last name
    physical_appearance:
     - eye_color: eye color
      hair_color: hair color
      height: `bold`|height in float value
      weight: |weight in float value|bold|weight in float value
    place_of_birth: location
    role: role of the character
    species: species
```

And here's the corrected Markdown code block:
```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: exact age or description
    background: background story
    first_name: first name
    id: id
    last_name: last name
    physical_appearance:

      hair_color: hair color
      height: `bold`|height in float value
      weight: |weight in float value|bold|weight in float value
    place_of_birth: location
