Here's the corrected YAML data:
```yaml
game:
  character:
    name: <name>
    physical_appearance:
      eye_color: <color_code>
      hair_color: <color_code>
      height: <numeric-value>
      weight: <numeric-value>
    place_of_birth: <place_of_birth>
    role: <role>
    species: <species>

```
Note that the syntax has been corrected to match the expected structure in the YAML file. Additionally, new values have been provided if necessary. If there is nothing wrong, only return the YAML in a code block (between ```yaml and ```). The original message is provided between ```yaml and ```.
