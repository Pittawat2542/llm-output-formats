Here's the corrected YAML data:
```
game:
  character:
    age: 30
    background:
      description: James Sirius Potter, a powerful wizard from the Wizarding World.
      id: JamesSir Potter
    first_name (string): James
    last_name (string): Potter
    physical_appearance: 
      eye_color: Green
      hair_color: Black
      height: 6 feet 3 inches
      weight: 250 pounds
```
The syntax was correct and the new values were included. The output format is correct in YAML format with the Markdown code block as follows:
```yaml
