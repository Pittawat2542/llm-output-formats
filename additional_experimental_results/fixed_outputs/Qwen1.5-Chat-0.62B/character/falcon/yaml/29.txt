The code looks correct. The YAML data is stored in the variable `game` and its elements are defined using curly braces `{}`.

Here's the corrected code:
```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 0
    background: None
    first_name: John Smith
    id: John Smith
    last_name: Smith
    physical_appearance:
       - eye_color: blue
        hair_color: brown 
        height: 5'8"
        weight: 150
      place_of_birth: Los Angeles
    role: Warrior
    species: Human
```

Output in YAML format:
```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 0
    background: None
    first_name: John Smith
    id: John Smith
    last_name: Smith
    physical_appearance:
       - eye_color: blue
        hair_color: brown 
        height: 5'8"
        weight: 150
      place_of_birth: Los Angeles
    role: Warrior
    species: Human
```
