The YAML data you provided is correct and contains the expected elements. Here's the corrected code:
```yaml
# Output in YAML format
# Character
age: | 
  character
background:. | 
    first_name: ~. | 
        last_name: |- 
          character
id: | 
            last_name: +. | 
              physical_appearance:
                - eye_color: @eye
                - hair_color: @hair
                - height: <@weight> in <@height>
            place_of_birth: |- |
              location
              @species
```
This will produce the following output in YAML format and Markdown code block:
```yaml
# Output in YAML format
# Character
age: | 
  character
background:. | 
    first_name: ~. | 
        last_name: |- 
          character
id: | 
            last_name: +. | 
              physical_appearance:
                - eye_color: @eye
                - hair_color: @hair
                - height: <@weight> in <@height>
            place_of_birth: |- |
              location
              @species
```
