The correct YAML data should look like this:
```
game:
  character:
    age: 25 or a description
    background: A story about your background,
    first_name: Your first name
    last_name: Your last name
    physical_appearance:
     - gender: Male
     - eye_color: Brown, Green
     - hair_color: Black
     - height: 6'2" or "2'5"
     - weight: 120 lbs
```

The syntax error in the original code is in line 3, column 10. It should be changed as follows:
```yaml
age: Your age or a description, e.g.
```
This will fix the syntax error and provide a correct message. The updated YAML data is now:
```
game:
  character:
    age: 25 or a description
    background: A story about your background,
    first_name: Your first name
    last_name: Your last name
    physical_appearance:
     - gender: Male
     - eye_color: Brown, Green
     - hair_color: Black
     - height: 6'2" or "2'5"
     - weight: 120 lbs
```

The output in Markdown format is now:
```
game:
  character:
    age: 25 or a description
    background: A story about your background,
    first_name: Your first name
    last_name: Your last name
    physical_appearance:
     - gender: Male
     - eye_color: Brown, Green
     - hair_color: Black
     - height: 6'2" or "2'5"
     - weight: 120 lbs
```

The Markdown code block is now in the correct format and contains the YAML data.
