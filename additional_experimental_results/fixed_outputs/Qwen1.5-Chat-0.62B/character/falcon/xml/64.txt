Here is the corrected XML data:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<character id="id" first-name="first name" last-name="last name">
	<input type="text" name="specs" placeholder="The role of the character"> <input type="text" name="age" placeholder="The character's age"> <input type="text" name="role" placeholder="The character's role"> <input type="text" name=" spell" placeholder="The spell"> <input type="text" name="spell"> 
	</character>
</game>
```
Here are the new values provided in the Markdown code block:
