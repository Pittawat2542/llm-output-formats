Here's the corrected XML data:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?> 
<game>
	<character id="id" first-name="first name", last-name="last name", species="species">
		<age>exact age or description</age>
		<role>role of the character</role>
		《背景故事》
		<!-- place of birth -->
		<!-- physical appearance -->
	</character>
</game>
```

In the original code, there was a syntax error that prevented it from being properly formatted. The correct syntax for creating an `<character>` element is:
```xml
<character>
	<first-name>first name</first-name>
	<last-name>last name</last-name>
	<title>角色名称</title>
	<species>物种名称</species>
</character>
```

And the code block that caused the error would have been:
```csharp
Character id = "id";
First Name firstName = "first name";
Last Name lastName = "last name";
Species species = "species";
Age age = exact年龄 or description;
Role role = "role of the character";
Background backgroundStory = <《背景故事》>";
Place of Birth birthplace = "location";
Physical Appearance physicalAppearance = <eye-color>eye color</eye_color>
HairColor hairColor = <hair-color>hair color</hair_color>
Height heightInFloatValue = 15.0;
Weight weightInFloatValue = 8.5;
```

And the corrected code block that caused the error would have been:
```csharp
Character id = "id";
First Name firstName = "first name";
Last Name lastName = "last name";
Species species = "species";
Age age = exact年龄 or description;
Role role = "role of the character";
Background backgroundStory = <《背景故事》>";
Place of Birth birthplace = "location";
Physical Appearance physicalAppearance = <eye-color>eye color</eye_color>
HairColor hairColor = <hair-color>hair color</hair_color>
Height heightInFloatValue = 15.0;
Weight weightInFloatValue = 8.5;
```

Note that the correct syntax for creating a `<character>` element is:
```csharp
<character>
	<title>角色名称</title>
	<species>物种名称</species>
</character>
```

And the code block that caused the error would have been:
```csharp
Character id = "id";
