```xml
<game xmlns="http://example.com/xml/> 
```

The correct syntax for the XML data is:
```xml
<game>
    <character>
        <id id="id" first-name="first name" last-name="last name" species="species" age="exact age or description" role="role of the character" background="background story" place-of-birth="location" physical-appearance>
            <eye-color>eye color</eye_color>
            <hair-color>hair color</hair_color>
            <height>height value</height>
            <weight>weight value</weight>
        </character>
    </game>
</game>
```

The new values in the XML data include:
- `<id>` - a unique identifier for each character in the game.
- `<first-name>` - the first name of each character.
- `<last-name>` - the last name of each character.
- `<species>` - the species of each character.
- `<age>` - the age of each character.
- `<role>` - the role of each character.
- `<background>` - the background story for each character.
- `<place-of-birth>` - the location where each character was born.
- `<physical-appearance>` - the physical appearance of each character in its default state.
