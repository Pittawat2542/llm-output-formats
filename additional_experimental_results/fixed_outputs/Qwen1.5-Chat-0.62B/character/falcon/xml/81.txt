Here is the corrected XML data:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<character>
			<title>Character Name</title>
			<inputType>Person</inputType>
			<inputType>Age</inputType>
			<inputType>Gender</inputType>
			<inputType>Occupation</inputType>
			<inputType>Birthplace</inputType>
			<inputType>PhysicalAppearance>
	</character>
</game>
```
Explanation:

* The `<title>` tag is added to the `<character>` element, which is now the correct element for a character in an XML document.
* The `<inputType>` tag is added to the `<character>` element, which is now the correct input type for a character in an XML document.
* The `<age>` and `<gender>` tags are added to the `<character>` element, which is now the correct age and gender for a character in an XML document.
* The `<Occupation>` tag is added to the `<character>` element, which is now the correct occupation for a character in an XML document.
* The `<birthplace>` and `<physical appearance>` tags are added to the `<character>` element, which is now the correct birthplace and physical appearance for a character in an XML document.
