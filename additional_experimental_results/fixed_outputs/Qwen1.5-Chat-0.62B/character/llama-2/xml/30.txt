The correct syntax for an XML data is to use `<` tags followed by child elements, and then closing them with `>` tags. In this case, the incorrect syntax is missing a opening `<` tag and closing it with a `</>` tag.
Here's the corrected code:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE game>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Character Profile</title>
</head>
<body>

	<h1>Character Profile</h1>

	<p>First Name: John Doe</p>
	<p>Last Name: Smith</p>
	<p>Species: Human</p>
	<p>Age: 25</p>
	<p>Role: Student</p>
	<p>Background Story: I have always loved science and math.</p>
	<p>Place of Birth: New York City</p>
	<p>Physical Appearance: Blue eyes, brown hair, long straight hair, 5 feet tall with a 70-inch waist. I am known for my quick thinking and ability to solve problems.</p>

</body>
</html>
```
In this code, the `<!DOCTYPE>` tag is used to indicate that the document is in XML format and the `<` tags are used to define the structure of the document. The `<h1>` tag is used to define the heading of the page and the `<p>` tag is used to define a paragraph with the text "Character Profile". The `<p>` tag contains child elements such as the `first-name`, `last-name`, `species`, `age`, `role`, `background`, and `place-of-birth`.
