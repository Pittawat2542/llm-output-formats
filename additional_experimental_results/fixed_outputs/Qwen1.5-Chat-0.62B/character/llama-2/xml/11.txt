The incorrect syntax is not well-formed (invalid token), which means the XML data does not contain a valid opening tag or closing tag. To fix this, we need to ensure that there are properly闭 tags in each line of the XML data.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?> 
<game>
	<character>
			<id>id</id>
			<title>Title of Game</title>
			 description>Description of Game</description>
			species>Species of Game</species>
			age>Age of Game</age>
			role>Role of Game</role>
			background>Background of Game
			place-of-birth>Birth Place of Game</place-of-birth>
		 physical-appearance>Physical Appearance of Game
	</character>

	<game>
		<!-- Add the closing tags for each line -->
	</game>
</game>
```

This corrected XML data now has properly闭 tags in each line to make it well-formed and valid. We can now use the code block provided between `<?xml` and `?>` to output the corrected XML data to the console:

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

root = ET.fromstring('game.xml')

for child in root:
    print(child.tag, child.text)
```
