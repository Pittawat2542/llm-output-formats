The `# Example` tag is used to define the template and content of the page. The `<game>` element is the root element of the HTML document and contains the content of the template. The `<character>` element represents the character in this example, and it has a `id`, `first-name`, `last-name`, `species`, `age`, `role`, `background`, `place-of-birth`, and `physical-appearance` attributes.
