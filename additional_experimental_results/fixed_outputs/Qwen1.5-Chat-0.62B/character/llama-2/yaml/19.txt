Here is the correct YAML data with new values:
```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: exact age or description
    background: background story
    first_name: first name
    id: id
    last_name: last name
    physical_appearance:
    - eye_color: eye color
      hair_color: hair color
      height: height in float value
      weight: weight in float value
    place_of_birth: location
    role: role of the character
    species: species
    age: 22
```
The syntax has been corrected to be consistent with Python 3.x and Markdown. If there is nothing wrong, only return the YAML in a code block (between ```yaml and ```).
