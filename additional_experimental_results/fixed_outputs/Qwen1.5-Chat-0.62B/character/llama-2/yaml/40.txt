Here's the corrected YAML data:
```
game:
  character:
    age: 25
    background: was raised in the slums of the city
    first_name: John
    id: 123
    last_name: Smith
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: green
        hair_color: brown
        height: 5'10'
        weight: 160
      - eye_color: blue
        hair_color: black
        height: 7'4"
        weight: 205
    place_of_birth: Earth
    role: police officer
    species: human
```

The error is in the syntax. The correct syntax for a `game` object in YAML would be:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 25
    background: was raised in the slums of the city
    first_name: John
    id: 123
    last_name: Smith
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: green
        hair_color: brown
        height: 5'10'
        weight: 160
    place_of_birth: Earth
    role: police officer
    species: human
```

This syntax correctly specifies the `age` and `background` properties for each `game` object, as well as the `first_name`, `id`, `last_name`, and `physical_appearance` properties. The `role` and `species` properties are also correct in this context.
