The YAML data should be corrected as follows:
```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 21
    background: The character was born in a small town in the United States. 
    first_name: John Smith
    id: 21
    last_name: Johnson
    physical_appearance:
     - eye_color: brown
      hair_color: black
      height: 5'11"
      weight: 180 lbs
    place_of_birth: United States
    role: A police officer
    species: Human
```
The syntax should be correct as follows:
```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 21
    background: The character was born in a small town in the United States. 
    first_name: John Smith
    id: 21
    last_name: Johnson
    physical_appearance:
     - eye_color: brown
      hair_color: black
      height: 5'11"
      weight: 180 lbs
    place_of_birth: United States
    role: A police officer
    species: Human
```
New values for the `first_name` and `last_name` variables should be provided if needed.
```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 21
    background: The character was born in a small town in the United States. 
    first_name: John Smith Johnson
    id: 21
    last_name: Johnson
    physical_appearance:
     - eye_color: brown
      hair_color: black
      height: 5'11"
      weight: 180 lbs
    place_of_birth: United States
    role: A police officer
    species: Human
```
The `first_name` and `last_name` variables should now be provided in the code block. The original message is now between ```yaml and ```.
```yaml
template:
game:
  character:
    age: 21
    background: The character was born in a small town in the United States. 
    first_name: John Smith
    id: 21
    last_name: Johnson
    physical_appearance:
     - eye_color: brown
      hair_color: black
      height: 5'11'
      weight: 180 lbs
    place_of_birth: United States
    role: A police officer
    species: Human
```
The output format is the same as the [YAML](https://yaml.org/) format.
## Tests
```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 21
    background: The character was born in a small town in the United States. 
    first_name: John Smith Johnson
    id: 21
    last_name: Johnson
    physical_appearance:
     - eye_color: brown
      hair_color: black
      height: 5'11'
      weight: 180 lbs
    place_of_birth: United States
    role: A police officer
    species: Human
```
The output format is the same as the [YAML](https://yaml.org/) format.

The `first_name` and `last_name` variables should now be provided in the code block. The original message is now between ```yaml and ```.
