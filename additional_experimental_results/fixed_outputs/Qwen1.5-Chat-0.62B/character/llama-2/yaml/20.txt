The YAML data is correct. The syntax and values are present in the correct order, including the `game` key with its value of `game`, `character` with its value of `character`, `age` with its value of 20, `background` with a description, `first_name` with a value of "Sam", `id` with a value of `1234567890`, `last_name` with a value of "Sullivan", and ` physical_appearance` with values for eye_color and hair_color. The output is:

```yaml

    age: 20
    background: "Adopted"
    first_name: "Sam"
    id: 1234567890
