The correct YAML data for the "game" object is:
```
game:
  character:
    age: 27
    background: I'm a hard worker.
    first_name: John
    id: 123
    last_name: Doe
    physical_appearance:
     - eye_color: brown
      hair_color: brown
      height: 6'2"
      weight: 180 lbs
    place_of_birth: New York
    role: Actor
    species: Human
```
The syntax error in the original YAML data is when there are an incorrect space before "age". The correct syntax for this section of code would be:
```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 27
    background: I'm a hard worker.
    first_name: John
    id: 123
    last_name: Doe
```
The new values provided for the "id" field in the "game" object are:
- id: 123
- last_name: Doe
The Markdown code block containing the original YAML data is:
```yaml

    first_name: John
