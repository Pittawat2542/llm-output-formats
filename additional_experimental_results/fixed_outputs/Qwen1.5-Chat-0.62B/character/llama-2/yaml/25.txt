The incorrect syntax was found in line 16, column 1. The correct syntax would be:

```
^
```

Here is the corrected YAML data:
```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: exact age or description
    background: background story
    first_name: first name
    id: id
    last_name: last name
    physical_appearance:
    - eye_color: eye color
      hair_color: hair color
      height: height in float value
      weight: weight in float value
    place_of_birth: location
    role: role of the character
    species: species
```

The error was caused by the incorrect syntax for opening a new line after scanning for a token. The correct syntax would be to use `` instead of ``.
