The YAML data was incorrect, and it should be corrected to properly match the requirements. Here's the corrected code:
```
game:
  character:
    age: exact age or description
    background: background story
    first_name: first name
    id: id
    last_name: last name
    physical_appearance:
     - eye_color: eye color
      hair_color: hair color
      height: 170
      weight: 80
    place_of_birth: location
    role: role of the character
    species: species
    age: exact age or description
```
In the `age` field, use the correct format (e.g. `age=28`) and make sure the `description` field is present for both `first_name` and `last_name`. The `height` and `weight` fields should be in a floating-point value format.
The new code will return the YAML in a code block between ```yaml``` and ````````.
```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: exact age or description
    background: background story
    first_name: first name
    id: id
    last_name: last name
    physical_appearance:
     - eye_color: eye color
      hair_color: hair color
      height: 170
      weight: 80
    place_of_birth: location
    role: role of the character
    species: species
    age: exact age or description
```
The Markdown code block will contain only the YAML data and it will be returned in a code block between ```yaml``` and ````````.
```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: exact age or description
    background: background story
    first_name: first name
    id: id
    last_name: last name
    physical_appearance:
     - eye_color: eye color
      hair_color: hair color
      height: 170
      weight: 80
    place_of_birth: location
    role: role of the character
    species: species
```
