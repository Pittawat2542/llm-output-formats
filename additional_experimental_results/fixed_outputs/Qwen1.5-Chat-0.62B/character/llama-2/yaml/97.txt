The provided YAML data is correct. The syntax has been correctly corrected and values have been added if necessary. Here's the revised code block:
```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 18
    background: "I was born in a small town in the middle of nowhere." 
    first_name: "Kat"
    id: 123
    last_name: "Carter"
    physical_appearance:
     - eye_color: brown
      hair_color: black
      height: 165
      weight: 50
    place_of_birth: " Townsville"
    role: "Leader"
    species: "Human"
```
The output in YAML format is as follows:
```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 18
    background: "I was born in a small town in the middle of nowhere." 
    first_name: "Kat"
    id: 123
    last_name: "Carter"
    physical_appearance:
     - eye_color: brown
      hair_color: black
      height: 165
      weight: 50
    place_of_birth: " Townsville"
