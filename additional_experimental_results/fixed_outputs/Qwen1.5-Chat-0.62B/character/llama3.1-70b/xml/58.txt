The correct syntax for the XML data is as follows:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?> <game>

   <first-name>Eira</first-name>
   <last-name>Shadowglow</last-name>
   <species_HALF-ELF</species>
   <age>25 years old</age> 
   <role>Rogue/Assassin</role>
   <background>Eira was born to a human father and an elven mother in a small village on the edge of a vast forest. She grew up learning the ways of stealth and deception from her mother, who was a skilled huntress. Eira' s parents were killed in a bandit raid when she was just a teenager, and she has been seeking revenge ever since.</background>
