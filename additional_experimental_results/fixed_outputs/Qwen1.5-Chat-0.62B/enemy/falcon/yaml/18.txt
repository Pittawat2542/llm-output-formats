The YAML data is incorrect and should be corrected. The correct syntax for mapping values is "value -> key". In the provided code, there are a couple of issues with the code structure:

  1. There is a missing closing parenthesis at line 3.
  2. There is an error in the value assigned to the `id` parameter.

Here is the corrected YAML data:
```yaml
 enemy: ~
description: [description]
id: [id]
name: [name]
stats:
  atk: [atk]
  def: [def]
    hp: [hp]
    mp: [mp]
    mph: [mph]
```

The code now properly maps the values to their corresponding keys, and the `id` parameter is correctly assigned.
