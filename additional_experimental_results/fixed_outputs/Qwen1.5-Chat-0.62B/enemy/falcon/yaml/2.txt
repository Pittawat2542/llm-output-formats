Here is the corrected YAML data:
```yaml
 enemies:
  -敌_name: enemy
  - description: enemy description
  - id: enemy_id
  - name: enemy_name
  - atk: atk int value
  - def: def int value
  - hp: hp int value
  - mp: mp int value
  - spd: spd int value
```
The syntax has been corrected in the YAML data. The new values for ` enemies` include `-敌_name: enemy`, `-description: enemy description`, and `-id: enemy_id`. If there are no errors in the YAML data, the output is:
```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: enemy_id
    name: enemy_name
    stats:
      atk: atk int value
      def: def int value
      hp: hp int value
      mp: mp int value
      spd: spd int value
```
This is in YAML format and includes the Markdown code block containing the original message. The output is the correct YAML data with new values added to it.
