Corrected YAML data:
```yaml
Battle:
  game: 1
  each_round:
    enemy: 1
    each_round_time: 15
    game__rules:
      - rules = {"game-keywords":{"name":"spawns", "each_round":{"game__rules":{"规则":[]}}}}
```
New values for the " enemies" and "each_round" blocks are provided in the YAML. The updated version also includes new values for the "name" and "each_round_time" columns in the game rules block. If there is nothing wrong, only the correct YAML data is returned as a code block (between ```yaml and ```).
