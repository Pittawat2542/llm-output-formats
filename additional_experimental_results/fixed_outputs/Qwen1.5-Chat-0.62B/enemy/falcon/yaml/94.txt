The YAML data has a syntax issue. The second `| enemylocation |` line should be placed after the first `|`. Therefore, the corrected YAML data would be:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: atk int value
      def: def int value
      hp: hp int value
      mp: mp int value
      wd: wd int value
```

The new values for `atk`, `def`, and `hp` are:

```yaml
| enemylocation | description | atk | def |
|敌location | description | 20   | 15    |
|敌location | description | 30   | 24    |
| enemylocation | description | 35   | 26    |
```

The Markdown code block is now:
```yaml
| enemylocation | description | atk | def |
|敌location | description | 20   | 15    |
|敌location | description | 30   | 24    |
|敌location | description | 35   | 26    |
```

The YAML data is now in Markdown format and only includes the new values for `atk`, `def`, and `hp`.
