The YAML data is correct. The only change needed is to add the correct syntax for mapping values to be allowed in this case. Here's the corrected code:
```
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: 20, def: 10, hp: 8, mp: 6, speed: 4
```

The modified code now correctly maps the `atk` and `def` values to their corresponding values in the `stats` dictionary.
