The correct XML data is provided between ```xml and ```:

```
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<enemy>
			<id>id</id>
			<title> enemy</title>
			<hp>A</hp>
		/mp	A</mp>
		atk	A</atk>
		(def>B</def>
			spd	A</spd>
	</敌人>
</game>
```

New values for the enemy and stats can be added as needed. If there is nothing wrong, the output in XML format is provided in a code block (between ```xml and ```) with the original message between ```xml and ```.

```xml
<game>
	<enemy id="id" hp="100" mp="50"atk="25" def="65" spd="20" />
	< enemy id="id"hp="450" mp="600"atk="300" def="250" spd="300" />
</game>
```

Output in Markdown format is provided between ```xml and ```:
敌 #id HP A MP Atk A def Spd A
```

Note: The code block within the `<game>` tag has been replaced with a code block to provide the output.
