```xml
 enemy:
  id: 1, name: "Name", description: "Description",
  stats:
   HP: 50, MP: 30,atk: 20, Def: 40,spd: 10
```

The fix was in the `hp` and `mp` attributes of the enemy object. The `def` attribute is missing as it should be a string value. The new values for `HP` and `MP` are now set to 50 and 30 respectively, while the `atk` and `Def` attributes have been updated to be strings with their corresponding values.
Output: <game>
  < enemy>
    <id>1</id>
    <name>Name</name>
    <description>Description</description>
    <stats>
      <HP>50</HP>
      <MP>30</MP>
      <atk>20</atk>
      <Def>40</Def>
      <spd>10</spd>
    </stats>
  </ enemy>
</game>
