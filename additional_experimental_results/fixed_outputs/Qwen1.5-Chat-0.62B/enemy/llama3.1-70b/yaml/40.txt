Here's the corrected YAML data:
```
game: 
  enemy: 
    description: A fearsome foe stands before you. 
    id: '8142' 
    name: Enemy 8142 
    stats: 
      atk: 24
      def: 14
      hp: 142
      mp: 43
      spd: 9
    stats:
      def: def int value
      def: def int value
      def: def int value
      def: def int value
```
