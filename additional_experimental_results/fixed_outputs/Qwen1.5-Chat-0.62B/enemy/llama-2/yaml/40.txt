Here's the corrected YAML data:
```
game:
  enemy:
    description: "This is a description"
    id: "id"
    name: "name"
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 100
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100
```

And here's the corrected Markdown code block with the new values:
```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "This is a description"
    id: "id"
    name: "name"
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 100
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
