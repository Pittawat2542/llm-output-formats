Here is the corrected YAML data:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "description"
    id: 1
    name: "name"
    stats:
      atk: 20, def: 40, hp: 60
```

Explanation:
- The `id` field was removed because it is already present in the YAML data.
- The `name` field was removed because it is already present in the YAML data.
- The `stats` field was added with two new values of type `atk`, `def`, and `hp`.
- The `id` field is now used to uniquely identify each enemy.

Output:
```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "description"
    id: 1
    name: "name"
    stats:
      atk: 20, def: 40, hp: 60
```

Note: The output now includes an extra `id` field for each enemy. This is done to distinguish the different enemies in the game.
