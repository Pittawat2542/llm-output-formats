The incorrect YAML data is the following:

```
## Example
game:
  enemy:
    description: "Enemy description"
    id: "enemy id"
    name: "敌
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 50
      hp: 50
      mp: 50
      spd: 50
```
The correct syntax is:

```
## Example
game:
  enemy:
    description: "Enemy description"
    id: "敌id"
    name: "敌"
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 50
      hp: 50
      mp: 50
     spd: 50
```
The new values for the enemy and stats are:

```
game:
  enemy:
    description: "敌"
    id: " Enemyid"
    name: "敌"
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 50
      hp: 50
      mp: 50
     spd: 50
```
The correct Markdown code block for the output is:

```yaml
## Example
game:
  enemy:
    description: "敌"
    id: "Enemyid"
    name: "敌"
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 50
      hp: 50
      mp: 50
     spd: 50
```
