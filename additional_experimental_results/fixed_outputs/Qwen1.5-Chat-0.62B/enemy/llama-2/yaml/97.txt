To fix the YAML data, we need to add a closing parenthesis before the `def` statement. Also, we need to change the `id` to `name` instead of `敌人` since it should be used as the name for an enemy.

Here's the corrected YAML code:
```
game:
  enemies:
    - description: "Description"
    id: "敌1"
    name: "敌1 Name"
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 100
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100
```

Now, this code should work correctly with the original YAML data.
