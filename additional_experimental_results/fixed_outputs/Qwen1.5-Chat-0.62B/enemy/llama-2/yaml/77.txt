The YAML data you provided is correct. Here's the corrected code:
```
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: "id"
    name: "name"
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 100
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
     spd: 100
```

The output should look like this:
```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "description"
    id: "id"
    name: "name"
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 100
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
     spd: 100
```

No issues were found with the syntax.
