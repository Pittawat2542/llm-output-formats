Here's the corrected YAML data with new values for `description`, `id`, and `name`:
```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "A description of the enemy"
    id: "enemy-id"
    name: "敌名"
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 100
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      wd: 100
```

The `id` and `name` are set to ` enemy-id` and `敌名`, respectively. The `atk`, `def`, `hp`, `mp`, and `wd` values have been updated to reflect the correct values for these attributes. The ` wd` attribute is set to `100`. The `atk`, `def`, `hp`, and `mp` values have been set to 100, 100, 100, and 100 respectively.
