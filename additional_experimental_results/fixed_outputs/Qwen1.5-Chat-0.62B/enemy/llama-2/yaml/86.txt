To fix the YAML data, you need to change the value of the `id` variable to `1`. Here's an example:
```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: This is a description
    id: 1
    name: "Name"
```

This will correct the syntax and provide new values if needed. If there is nothing wrong, only return the YAML in a code block (between ```yaml and ```). The original message is provided between ```yaml and ```. Return output in YAML format and only the YAML in the Markdown code block.
```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: This is a description
    id: 1
    name: "Name"
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 100
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100
```
