The YAML data is correct, and it was not provided in the original message. It should now be returned in a code block (between ```yaml and ```) as expected. The original message is provided between ```yaml and ```. 
```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: The enemy's description.
    id: 1
    name: The enemy's name.
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 100
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      wd: 100
``` [/USAGE]

# Usage
```bash
$ python3 <file.py> $ python3 test.py
```
```bash
$ python3 --version
```

The updated YAML data should be returned in the Markdown code block as expected.
