```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: The dragon.
    id: 1
    name: The dragon.
    stats:
      atk: 20
      def: 20
      hp: 20
      mp: 20
      mond: 20
```

Explanation:

- `^` is a character that matches the opening character of a line. In this case, it matches the opening character for line 1 and column 1.
- `^` matches the closing character of a line. In this case, it matches the closing character for line 2 and column 2.
- `[}` is used to mark the end of a line in YAML.
- The YAML string provided is correct.

```bash
$./demo.sh
```
