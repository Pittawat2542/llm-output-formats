To fix the YAML data, we can remove the double quotes around the `id` and `name` variables. Here's the corrected code:

```
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 100
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100
```

Now, the correct YAML data is:

```
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 100
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
     spd: 100
```

Here's the Markdown code block that shows the corrected YAML data:

## Examples
```yaml

    stats:

      def: 100
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      wd: 100
```
