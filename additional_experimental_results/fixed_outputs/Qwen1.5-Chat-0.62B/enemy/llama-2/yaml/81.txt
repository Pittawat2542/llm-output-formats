The YAML data is correct, and the output is in Markdown format. The only thing missing is a code block between the `game` and ` enemy` elements to properly close them. Here's the corrected code:
```
## Game
### enemies
- description: "description"
  id: "id"
  name: "name"

## Game
# enemies
- description: "description"
  id: "id"
  name: "name"

```
