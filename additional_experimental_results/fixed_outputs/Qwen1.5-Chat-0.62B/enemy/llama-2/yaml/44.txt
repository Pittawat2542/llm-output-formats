The YAML data is correct. The input format specified above is also correct. There are no syntax errors in the provided code block.
```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: atk int value
      def: def int value
      hp: hp int value
      mp: mp int value
      spd:spd int value
```

The only syntax error in the code block is the use of `int` instead of `int` as a type. The correct type for the `hp` variable should be `int`.
