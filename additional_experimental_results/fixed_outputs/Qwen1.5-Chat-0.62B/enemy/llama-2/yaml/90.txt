The YAML data is incorrect and needs to be corrected. The syntax of the code is incorrect and should be changed to match the correct YAML format.
```
## Example
## Example input

game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: atk int value
      def: def int value
      hp: hp int value
      mp: mp int value
      spd: wd int value
      [敌]
```

Here is the corrected YAML data:
```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: atk int value
      def: def int value
      hp: hp int value
      mp: mp int value
      wd: wd int value
      [敌]
```

The output of the Markdown code block will be the same as the original YAML data with the corrected syntax.
