Here are the corrected and new values for the elements:
1. The "id" element is missing, so it is set to "0". 
2. The "name" element is not properly formatted, so it is set to an empty string.
3. The "description" element has no value.
4. The "stats" element has a single attribute named "hp", which is set to the value of 15 and 40.
5. The "stats" element does not have any attribute named "mp", "atk", or "def".
6. The "stats" element does not have any attribute named "spd".
