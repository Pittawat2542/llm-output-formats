```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text: dialogue or narration
```

The original YAML data contained incorrect syntax due to the use of single quotes instead of double quotes for the string content. The fixed version uses double quotes and includes new values for the game, dialogues, and order attributes.
