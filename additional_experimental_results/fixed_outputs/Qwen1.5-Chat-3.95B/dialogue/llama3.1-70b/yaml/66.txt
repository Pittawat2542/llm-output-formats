```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text: dialogue or narration
```

The original YAML data contained an incorrect character in the opening triple quote (````) which caused the error message. The corrected YAML data only contains single quotes (`'`) and does not contain any issues with syntax.
