The YAML data is correct and there is no need to fix it. Here is the YAML code block:
```yaml
- order: dialogue order, text 
  speaker:
    name: speaker name
  text:
    narrative: narrative text, for example (spoken), could be dialogue, narrations, etc.
```
This YAML data represents a single game with its associated dialogues. It is ready to use and has no issues.
