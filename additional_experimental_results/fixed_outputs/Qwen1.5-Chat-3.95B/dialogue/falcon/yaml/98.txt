The YAML data needs to be corrected and provided with new values. The original message is incorrect and needs to be fixed.
Here is the corrected YAML data in Markdown format:
```yaml
Error: incorrect_syntax: while scanning for the next token
found character '`' that cannot start any token
  in "<unicode string>", line 3, column 11:
      - text: `Your dialogue here`
               ^
Invalid YAML: ```error```
