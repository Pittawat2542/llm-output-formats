The original message contains YAML syntax with incorrect characters and syntax. The YAML data needs to be reformatted to correct the syntax and provide new values. Here is the corrected YAML data:
```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text: dialogue or narration
```
Here is the YAML data with updated syntax and values in Markdown format:
```yaml
Game:
  Dialogues:
   - Order: dialogue order
    Speaker: speaker name
    Text: dialogue or narration
```
