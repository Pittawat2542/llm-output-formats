I need to convert the YAML data into a code block and then run it. Here is the code block:
```yaml
{
  "game": {
    "dialogues": [
      {
        "order": "0",
        "speaker": {"name": "character name"}},
      {
        "order": "1",
        "speaker": {"name": "character name"}}
    ]
  }
}
```
This is the YAML content that needs to be run.
