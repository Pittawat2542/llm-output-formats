The YAML data needs to be structured properly and include a `game` object with `dialogues` array. Here is the correct syntax:
```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text: dialogue or narration
```
Here is the updated YAML content in YAML format:
```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text: dialogue or narration
