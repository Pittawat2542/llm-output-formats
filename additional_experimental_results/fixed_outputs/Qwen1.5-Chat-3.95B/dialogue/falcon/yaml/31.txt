The original message contains a YAML string that includes incorrect syntax. The issue is with the use of a character `'` in the content, which cannot start any token. To fix the error and provide new values for the dialogues, please replace the YAML string with the following code:
```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - speaker: Player 1
    text: He/She likes playing games.
```
Here is the corrected YAML data:
```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - speaker: <Player 1>
    order: dialogue order
    text: She/He likes playing games.
```
Return output in YAML format:
```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - speaker: <Player 1>
    order: dialogue order
    text: She/He likes playing games.
