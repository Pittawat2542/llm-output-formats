 YAML data has been corrected and provides new values. Here's the updated YAML:
```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text: dialogue or narration
```
Output: ``` YAML
{"yaml": "game: dialogues: - order: dialogue order - speaker: speaker name - text: dialogue or narration"}
