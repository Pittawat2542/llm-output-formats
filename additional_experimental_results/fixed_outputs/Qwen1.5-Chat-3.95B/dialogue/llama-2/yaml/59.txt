This is an example of YAML with errors. The original message has been provided between ```yaml and ``` but the YAML data needs to be corrected and returned in Markdown format. I will provide a YAML error and its corrected version, followed by YAML output in Markdown format. Only the YAML code block will be included. YAML output:
```yaml
```
