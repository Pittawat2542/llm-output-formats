No problem, here's the corrected XML:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2019/WME#">
<game>
	<dialogues>
			<dialogue order="1"> Speaker: Bill Text: I like to go to the movies. </text> 
			<dialogue order="2"> Speaker: Susan Text: I like to go to the movies. </text> 
			<dialogue order="3"> Speaker: Joe Text: I like to go to the movies. </text> 
</game>
```
