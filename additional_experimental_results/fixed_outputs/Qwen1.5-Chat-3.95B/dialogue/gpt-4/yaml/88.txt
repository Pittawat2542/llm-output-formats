Invalid YAML syntax. The original message contains special characters and cannot be rendered without any changes. Here is the problem:
Error: incorrect_syntax: unacceptable character #x0081: special characters are not allowed
  in "<unicode string>", position 418
To fix this, please provide a new YAML text with valid syntax and the corrected content in YAML format. The original message should be reformatted as follows:
```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: 1
    speaker: Alice
    text: Where are we going, Bob?
   - order: 2
    speaker: Bob
    text: We're heading to the old mine.
   - order: 3
    speaker: Alice
    text: But isn't it dangerous?
   - order: 4
    speaker: Bob
    text: Yes, it's a bit risky. But don't worry, I'll protect you.
   - order: 5
    speaker: Narrator
    text: At that moment, they both felt a chilly wind pass byâ€c
Note that the original message is provided between ```yaml and ``` and should be updated accordingly.
