No problem. Here's the YAML with the corrected syntax:
```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: 1
    speaker: John
    text: Good morning, Amelia, beautiful weather today?  
   - order: 2
    speaker: Amelia
    text: Indeed, John. Perfect for our expedition.    
   - order: 3
    speaker: John
    text: Couldn't agree more. Let's hope we find that treasure today.  
   - order: 4
    speaker: Amelia
    text: Hope so, John. Remember, the team relies on us.
