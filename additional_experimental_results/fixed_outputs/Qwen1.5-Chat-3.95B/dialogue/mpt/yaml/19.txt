Error: YAML syntax issue in code block
  in "<unicode string>", line 7, column 12:
        speaker: NPC
                ^

Here is the fixed YAML content:
```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: 1
    speaker: player
    text: "Hey there, how are you?""
   - order:2
    speaker: NPC
    text: "I'm very well, it's a pleasure to meet you."`
 YAML code block:
```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: 1
    speaker: player
    text: "Hey there, how are you?"}
   - order:2
    speaker: NPC
    text: "I'm very well, it's a pleasure to meet you."}
