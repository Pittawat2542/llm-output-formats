				text>Hey, can you help me with this puzzle? I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with wind. What am I? The answer is an echo. The sound waves create the illusion of speech even though an echo itself does not physically speak. It doesn't have a body but it becomes alive when it reflects off surfaces.</text>
