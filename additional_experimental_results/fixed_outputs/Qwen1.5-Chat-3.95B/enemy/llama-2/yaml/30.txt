The YAML code needs to be reformatted and corrected for the error. Here is an example of what should be done:
```yaml
Error: incorrect_syntax: while scanning for the next token
found character '`' that cannot start any token
  in "<unicode string>", line 12, column 1:
     ```
     ^
Invalid YAML data
```
