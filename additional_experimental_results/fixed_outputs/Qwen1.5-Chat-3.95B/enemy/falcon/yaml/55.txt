Invalid YAML syntax. YAML string needs to be reformatted and corrected with new values. Here is the YAML in Markdown format:
```yaml
Error: invalid_syntax: while scanning for the next token
found character '@' that cannot start any token
  in "<unicode string>", line 7, column 12:
          atk: @atk
                ^
Invalid YAML data. Please provide a new YAML string and I will assist with fixing it.
