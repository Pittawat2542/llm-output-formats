  beginning: In the year 2035, in an alternate universe much like our own, a new drug made from the venom of genetically modified spiders has hit the streets of North America. After only a few months in mass production and distribution by an organized drug-smuggling cartel, the drug has quickly become the focus of the Federal Government. This is where you enter the picture: you are an ordinary man, not a drug dealer or a trafficker, not even an undercover agent, just an ordinary man who was sucked into the events and the turmoil around this drug. The drug is a highly addictive substance called "spiders" that has the potential to ravage human brain chemistry, as demonstrated by the increasing number of cases of severe mental illness, suicide, and multiple violent outbursts. In a last ditch effort to quash the distribution and use of this drug, the government has ordered what they call a "super-enforcement" of local law enforcement agencies. Local police are now equipped with a special device called a Venom Gun, which fires harmless "dummy" spider venom darts at suspects. The purpose of these darts is to render the suspects temporarily incapacitated, allowing law enforcement agents to swiftly arrest them. But there is a problem: some suspects have been able to get their hands on actual venom canisters, and so law enforcement agencies have developed another weapon designed to combat this threat. Armed with these newly-designed Venom Blast Assault Weapons, law enforcement agents can now spray "fake" spider venom directly on suspects during arrests, to render them helpless and force them to be arrested.

  ending: But that was the past. The present is a different story: your former best friend has become a hardened vigilante known as "Spiders", using his enhanced physical strength to attack all who have killed or abused his beloved girlfriend Mary Jane, whom he believes to be the source of all the problems plaguing his life. He now travels the country seeking out and killing those who do evil, vowing to avenge Mary Jane's death.

  synopsis: You know the story very well. In the beginning of this dark tale, you were just an ordinary man who had a normal, happy life. But then your life was turned upside-down after a freak accident in your kitchen. One of the spiders was in your fridge when it accidentally got knocked into a kettle of boiling water. This spider bite caused you to go temporarily insane, before your doctor managed to calm you down and give you a cure for your condition. The doctor also gave you a new mission: to find out how and why this drug was developed in the first place and find a solution to stop it from ever being made again.
