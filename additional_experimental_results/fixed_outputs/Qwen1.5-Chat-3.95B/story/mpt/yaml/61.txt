  title: Game
  beginning: 
     The world suddenly shifted to different dimensions and space-time!
     Fantasy creatures and heroes from legends sprang to life and fought!
  synopsis: 
     King Bard and his royal guards were ambushed by orc bands of all sorts.
     Heavy fighting ensued and many of his guards and servants lost their life
     to the many orc warriors. He and his few remaining guards retreated into the 
     castle as they could no longer fight with the numbers of the orcs!
     The remaining nobles were quick to surrender the castle to the Orcs as they didn't see 
     any hope left for the heroes. They surrendered the key to the castle door and the 
     key to the dungeon. 
     The warriors fought through the many challenges of the dungeon. Many traps, foes, and 
     curse laid before them, and they fought their way to the heart of the dungeon. 
     They had reached the treasure room at last! Yet, all treasure chests were empty and 
     barren. The king and his warriors sat down dejected, yet triumphant. 
     Asking if the treasure chest were empty, they were told, that the orcs had the 
     treasures. The king and his warriors were outraged over how the world treated them!
     They knew they could no longer sit in the world and allow the things they once saw 
     on fantasy novels to be a reality. The king declared that if he were to see his 
     castle and all that he loved, he was to conquer that which caused this.
     The warriors and king all entered the dungeon. Fighting against the many challenges of the dungeon. Many traps, foes, and 
     curse laid before them, and they fought their way to the heart of the dungeon.

     The king and his warriors charged together to the final chamber. The final battle - a final chance! 
     The king and his warriors stood at the heart of the dungeon and fought! Heavy blows 
     were struck by the king and his warriors, but they could not stand against all of the 
     orc warriors! With final heavy beats by the king to the orc champion themselves, the 
     orcs retreated back to the outside. 
     The king and his warriors stood victorious! 
     They looked at the castle, now a pile of dust. 
     The king and the few remaining warriors saw the orcs burning, the mountain they fled 
     to to escape the lightning. The king was saddened, but glad of his survival. 
     He realized he had to get his remaining men, treasure, and castle to safety, for 
     such danger to not ever come again!
