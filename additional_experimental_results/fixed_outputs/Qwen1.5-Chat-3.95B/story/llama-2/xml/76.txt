XML has been updated to correct syntax and values. Here's the new XML:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" xmlns="http://www.game.com/">
  <game>
    <title>game title</title>
    <synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
    <beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
    <ending>the ending of the game</ending>
    <author>game author</author>
    <created>game created date</created>
    <modified>game modified date</modified>
  </game>
```
