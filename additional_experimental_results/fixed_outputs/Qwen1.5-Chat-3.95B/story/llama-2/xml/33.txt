```xml

```XML is a set of instructions used to create content. It's the raw data that can be processed by other programs. This is how it looks like in code.

Here is what needs to be changed:

```
```xml
# Game title
## Game synopsis
### Game beginning
This is the game beginning.

### Game ending
This is the game ending.

## Game characters
### Character 1
Character 1 is a <mark>great</mark> character.

### Character 2
Character 2 is a <mark>great</mark> character.

### Character 3
Character 3 is a <mark>great</mark> character.
```
