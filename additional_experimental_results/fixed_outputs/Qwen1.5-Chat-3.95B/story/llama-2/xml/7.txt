Here is an example of how to fix the issue by providing new values for the XML data:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>example game title</title>
	<synopsis>example game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>the beginning of the example game</beginning>
	<ending>the ending of the example game</ending>
</game>
```
