The YAML data is not correct syntax and cannot be fixed. YAML requires a valid sequence of tags and values using a standard syntax with proper indentation and syntax errors. It appears to have been generated from unparseable or invalid data, which is preventing any output from the YAML in code block. I can provide some help with understanding what the original message was, but without the YAML data itself it cannot be fixed or returned any code block. Please provide the YAML in code format and any additional information that you need for assistance.
