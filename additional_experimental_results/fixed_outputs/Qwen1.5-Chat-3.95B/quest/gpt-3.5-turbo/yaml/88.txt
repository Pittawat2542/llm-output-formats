I cannot provide a YAML fix as it is an error. The original message is not provided between ```yaml and ``` and therefore there is no code to return. If you have any YAML data, please provide the message and I will assist with fixing it. YAML code block:
```yaml
Error: incorrect_syntax: while scanning for the next token
found character '`' that cannot start any token
  in "<unicode string>", line 21, column 1:
     ```
     ^
```
