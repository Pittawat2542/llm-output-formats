The original YAML code is missing some information about how it should be structured. I can see that there are some errors in the syntax, and it will need to be fixed before it can be used.
Here is the corrected YAML:
```yaml
game:
  description: Find the Lost Artifact
  id: 12345
  objective: Retrieve the ancient artifact from the hidden temple
  quest_giver: Archaeologist Johnson
  reward: 500 gold coins and a rare magical item
  tasks:
   - description: Solve the riddle at the entrance of the temple
    location: Temple of Mysteries
    objective: Find the correct answer to open the doors
    order: 1
   - description: Traverse through the treacherous maze inside the temple
    location: Maze of Shadows
    objective: Reach the central chamber without getting lost
    order: 2
   - description: Defeat the guardians protecting the ancient artifact
    location: Chamber of Guardians
    objective: Overcome the challenges and obstacles to claim the artifact
    order: 3
  title: The Lost Artifact
```
