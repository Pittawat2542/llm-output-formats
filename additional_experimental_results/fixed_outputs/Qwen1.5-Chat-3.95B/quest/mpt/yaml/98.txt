Game description is not required, but the developer can choose to include their quest description to help the players learn about the quest at a glance. They can add a list of tasks in the quest with their descriptions:

```yaml
description: quest description
  id: id
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
    tasks:
   - description: task description
    location: task location
    objective: task objective
    order: task order
```
```
