The original JSON data is not complete or valid. It contains syntax errors and needs to be corrected in order to return the correct JSON result.
Please provide new JSON data with the proper structure and values, and I will return it in JSON format. Here is the updated code:
```json
{
   "game": {
       "id": "id",
       "title": "quest title",
       "objective": "quest objective",
       "description": "quest description",
       "reward": "quest reward",
       "quest_giver": "quest giver",
       "tasks": [
         {
           "order": 1,
           "objective": "task objective",
           "description": "task description",
           "location": "task location"
         }
       ]
   }
}
```
