Error: YAML syntax error
  In "<unicode string>", line 1, column 1:
    title: This is the title of the quest
     ^

Expected <block end>, but found '-' in "<unicode string>", line 7, column 1:
   - A list of the quest's objectives
     ^

To fix this issue, please provide YAML code with a description of the game and its objectives. Include tasks for the quest and their rewards. YAML format is expected to be enclosed between ```yaml and ``` YAML code block.
