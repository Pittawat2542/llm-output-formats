In YAML, the original message is provided with an issue. The syntax needs to be corrected. The YAML data is invalid and should not be used directly.
Error: incorrect_syntax: while parsing a block mapping
  in "<unicode string>", line 1, column 3:
     - name: name
       ^
expected <block end>, but found '-'
  in "<unicode string>", line 2, column 3:
       - description: quest description
       ^

To fix the issue, please provide a YAML data block with correct syntax. The new value should be included in the YAML code block. Here is the YAML data:
```yaml
game:
  description: quest description
  id: id
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
   - id: task_id
    description: task description
    location: task location
    objective: task objective
```
```yaml
