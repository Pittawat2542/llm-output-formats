 YAML data error:
Error: invalid_syntax: while parsing a block mapping
  in "<unicode string>", line 1, column 1:
    game:
     ^expected <block end>, but found '<block mapping start>'
  in "<unicode string>", line 3, column 3:
      id: <id> # use your desired identifier for the markdown code block
       ^
Invalid YAML syntax:
Error: incorrect_syntax: while parsing a block mapping
  in "<unicode string>", line 1, column 1:
    game:
     ^expected <block end>, but found '<block mapping start>'
  in "<unicode string>", line 3, column 3:
      id: <id> # use your desired identifier for the markdown code block
       ^
To fix and provide new values, you need to modify the YAML data. Here is a corrected version with the correct syntax:
```yaml
game:
   description: quest description
  id: <id> # use your desired identifier for the markdown code block
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
   - description: task description
    location: task location
    objective: task objective
    order: task order
  title: quest title # use this in the markdown code block
