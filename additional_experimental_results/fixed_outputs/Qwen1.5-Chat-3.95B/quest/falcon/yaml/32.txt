The YAML data is missing details. It appears that there are some issues with the syntax and structure of the original message.
In order to fix the issue, we need to provide more information about what the original message is intended to represent. Can you please provide more context or describe the problem in detail? What are the specific details that need to be addressed? The YAML data you provided does not contain any errors, so there is nothing wrong with it.
If there was no problem, just return the YAML data in its current form:
```yaml
Return code
```
I would like to receive the YAML data in its original format with any additional instructions or specifications.
