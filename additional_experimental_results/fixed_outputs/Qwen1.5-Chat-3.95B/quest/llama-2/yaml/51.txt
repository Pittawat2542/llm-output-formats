The original message has syntax issues in YAML syntax. The YAML data is incorrect and needs to be corrected. In order to fix the issue, you need to provide new values for the properties of the game object. Here's a sample YAML with the correct syntax:
```yaml
game:
  description: quest description
  id: id
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
   - description: task description
    location: task location
    objective: task objective
    order: task order
  title: quest title
```
