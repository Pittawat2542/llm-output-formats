Invalid YAML syntax. It appears to be missing block end markers and values for `age` and `eye_color`. Here is the corrected YAML data:
```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: exact age or description
    background: "Grew up next to a magical forest. Spoke to animals and creatures. Always dreamed of going to the other side"
    first_name: "Lola"
    id: 123
    last_name: "Morgan"
    physical_appearance:
      eye_color: green

    - 
      hair_color: red
      height: 180
      weight: 60
    place_of_birth: "Los Angeles, California"
    role: 
    species: human
