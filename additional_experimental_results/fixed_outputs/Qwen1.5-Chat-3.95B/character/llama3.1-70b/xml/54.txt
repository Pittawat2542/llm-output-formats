		<background>Eira was born to a human father and elven mother in a secluded community on the edge of a dense forest. She was trained in stealth and deception from a young age by her elven relatives, who recognized her natural talent for sneaking and hiding. As she grew older, Eira became increasingly restless, feeling confined by the limits of her small community. She set out into the wider world to make a name for herself as a thief and assassin, using her skills to survive in a harsh and unforgiving environment.</background>
