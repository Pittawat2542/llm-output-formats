The YAML data is missing a key named "age", which should be a number. Here's the updated YAML:
```yaml
character.age: exact age or description
```
Return output in YAML format and only the YAML in the Markdown code block. YAML:
```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: exact age or description
    background: background story
    first_name: first name
    id: id
    last_name: last name
    physical_appearance:
     - eye_color: eye color
      hair_color: hair color
      height: height in float value
      weight: weight in float value
    place_of_birth: location
    role: role of the character
    species: species
