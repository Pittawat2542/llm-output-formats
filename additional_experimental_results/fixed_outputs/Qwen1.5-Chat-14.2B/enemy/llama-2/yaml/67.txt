The issue with the provided YAML data is that it uses backticks (`) instead of quotes for string values. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "The enemy's description"
    id: "The enemy's ID"
    name: "The enemy's name"
    stats:
      atk: 200
      def: 200
      hp: 200
      mp: 200
      spd: 200
```
All the examples provided were actually correct except for the first one which had a syntax error due to backticks. The fixed version is included above.
