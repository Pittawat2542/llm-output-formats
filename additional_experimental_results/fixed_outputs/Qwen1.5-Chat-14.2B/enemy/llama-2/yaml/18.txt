The YAML data provided was not incorrect, there were no syntax errors. The only thing that needed to be done was to remove the leading hash symbol (`#`) from each line, as it is not part of the YAML structure. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: Enemy description
    id: enemy id
    name: enemy name
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 50
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100
```
The code block representing the corrected YAML data is as follows:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: Enemy description
    id: enemy id
    name: enemy name
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 50
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100
```
