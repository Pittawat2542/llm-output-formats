The YAML data was correct, with only minor indentation adjustments. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "This is a description."
    id: 1
    name: "Enemy 1"
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 100
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100

tests:
  - name: "Test 1"
    input: "This is a test."
    expected:
      game:
        enemy:
          description: "This is a test."
          id: 1
          name: "Enemy 1"
          stats:
            atk: 100
            def: 100
            hp: 100
            mp: 100
            spd: 100

inputs:
  - name: "Input 1"
    description: "This is an input."
    type: string
    default: "This is a default value."

outputs:
  - name: "Output 1"
    description: "This is an output."
    type: string
    default: "This is a default value."
```

All the content is now properly indented and in the correct format.
