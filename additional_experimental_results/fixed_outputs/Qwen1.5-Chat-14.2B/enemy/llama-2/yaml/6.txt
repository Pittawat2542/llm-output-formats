The issue with the original YAML data is that it contains a backtick (`) character, which is not valid in this context. The backticks are likely intended for code snippets or inline programming within the Markdown document, but they are not needed in the YAML format. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: This is an enemy.
    id: 1
    name: Enemy 1
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 100
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100
```

This YAML is now correct and formatted according to the standard syntax.
