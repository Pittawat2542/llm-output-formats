The issue with the provided YAML data is that it has a string value starting with a backtick (`) instead of a double quote ("). Here's the corrected YAML for all the examples:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "Description"
    id: 1
    name: "Name"
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 100
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100
```

All the examples are identical, so I've provided only one. If you need to provide multiple examples with different values for `description`, `id`, or any other fields, please let me know.
