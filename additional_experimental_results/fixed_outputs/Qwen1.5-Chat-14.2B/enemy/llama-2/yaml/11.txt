The original YAML data is correct, and there was no issue with the syntax. The provided example is already in a valid YAML format. Here it is:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: atk int value
      def: def int value
      hp: hp int value
      mp: mp int value
      spd: spd int value
```

If you wanted to replace the placeholders with actual values, it would look like this:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "A fierce dragon"
    id: "DRAGON001"
    name: "Drakon"
    stats:
      atk: 250
      def: 150
      hp: 1200
      mp: 200
      spd: 80
```
