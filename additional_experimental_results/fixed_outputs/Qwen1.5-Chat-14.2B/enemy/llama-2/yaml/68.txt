The YAML syntax in the provided examples is correct, but there seems to be an unnecessary backtick (`) character at the end of each line. Here's the fixed YAML data without the extra backticks:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 100
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100
```
All the other examples have the same correct structure. If you intended to include more values or provide new descriptions, please provide the necessary information, and I'll update accordingly.
