The original YAML is correct, there were no syntax issues. Here's the fixed code block for the YAML:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "This is a description."
    id: "1"
    name: "Enemy 1"
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 100
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100
```
If you need new values, please provide them and I'll update the YAML accordingly.
