The issue with the provided YAML data is that it has a stray backtick character (`) at the end, which is causing the syntax error. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: The enemy's description.
    id: 1
    name: The enemy's name.
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 100
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100
```

The YAML is now correctly formatted, and no changes to the values were needed.
