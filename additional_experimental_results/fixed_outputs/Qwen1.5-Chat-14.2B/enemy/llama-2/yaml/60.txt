The issue with the original YAML data is that there is a stray backtick (`) character at the end of the file, which is not part of any valid syntax. I will remove it from the end to fix the incorrect syntax. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "A powerful enemy with high stats and a powerful attack."
    id: "01"
    name: "Skeleton"
    stats:
      atk: 250
      def: 200
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100
```

If you intended to have multiple examples, please provide the desired structure for them. Otherwise, this is the single fixed example.
