The original YAML data seems to be correct, with no syntax errors. Here's the corrected YAML in a code block:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id_value
    name: name_value
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 100
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100
```

If needed, you can replace `description`, `id_value`, and `name_value` with actual values.
