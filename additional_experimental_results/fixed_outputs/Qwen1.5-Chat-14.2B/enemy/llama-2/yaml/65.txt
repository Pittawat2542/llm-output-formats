The incorrect syntax in the original YAML data was due to including a Bash command inside string quotes. YAML does not support Bash code blocks directly, so I will remove them. If you need to include this information elsewhere (like a comment), you can do so outside the YAML structure. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
# Example: Running the main.js script
game:
  enemy:
    description: "Description of the enemy"
    id: "ID of the enemy"
    name: "Name of the enemy"
    stats:
      atk: "ATK value as an int"
      def: "DEF value as an int"
      hp: "HP value as an int"
      mp: "MP value as an int"
      spd: "SPD value as an int"

# Examples
# To run the main.js script:
# $./main.js
```

Note that I've replaced the Bash commands with text, and provided a comment above to indicate the original intention. If you need to execute a command in a script, it's better to include that in your application code or documentation outside of the YAML file.
