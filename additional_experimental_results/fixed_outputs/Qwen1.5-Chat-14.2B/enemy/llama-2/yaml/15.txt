The provided YAML data is correct, but there's a formatting issue in the code block. Here's the fixed YAML with proper indentation:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "A description"
    id: 1
    name: "A name"
    stats:
      atk: 1
      def: 2
      hp: 3
      mp: 4
      spd: 5
```

The backticks around the strings in the original version are not necessary for plain YAML, so I've replaced them with double quotes to indicate they are string values.
