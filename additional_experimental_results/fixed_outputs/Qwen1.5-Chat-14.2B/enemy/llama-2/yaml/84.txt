The issue with the provided YAML data is that it contains a backtick (`) character, which is not valid in this context. Backticks are typically used for multi-line strings or code blocks in YAML, but they should be removed when you want to represent simple text. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "The enemy is a human being."
    id: 1
    name: Human
    stats:
      atk: 10
      def: 10
      hp: 10
      mp: 10
      spd: 10
```

All the examples provided had this issue, so I've removed the backticks from the description.
