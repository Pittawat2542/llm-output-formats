```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "I am a cute little corgi"
    id: 1
    name: "Corgi"
    stats:
      atk: 20
      def: 20
      hp: 20
      mp: 20
      spd: 20
```

The issue was that there were no indentation errors. The given YAML data is correct and does not require any changes. I've provided the fixed YAML in a code block as requested.
