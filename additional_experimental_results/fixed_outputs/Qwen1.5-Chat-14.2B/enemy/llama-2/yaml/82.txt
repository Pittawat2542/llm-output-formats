```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "description"
    id: "id"
    name: "name"
    stats:
      atk: 10
      def: 20
      hp: 30
      mp: 40
      spd: 50
```
The original YAML data was incorrect due to the presence of a backtick (`) that doesn't belong in the syntax. I have removed it and provided default integer values for `atk`, `def`, `hp`, `mp`, and `spd`. If you need different values, replace them accordingly.
