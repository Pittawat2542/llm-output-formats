The issue with the original YAML data was that there were no spaces after commas in the nested `stats` dictionary. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "An enemy with a high attack stat."
    id: 1
    name: "Boss"
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 100
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100
```

If you want to have separate enemies with different descriptions, here's the YAML format for that:

```yaml
game:
  enemies:
    - description: "An enemy with a high attack stat."
      id: 1
      name: "Boss"
      stats:
        atk: 100
        def: 100
        hp: 100
        mp: 100
        spd: 100

    - description: "An enemy with a high defense stat."
      id: 2
      name: "Defense"
      stats:
        atk: 100
        def: 100
        hp: 100
        mp: 100
        spd: 100

    - description: "An enemy with a high health stat."
      id: 3
      name: "HP"
      stats:
        atk: 100
        def: 100
        hp: 100
        mp: 100
        spd: 100

    - description: "An enemy with a high magic stat."
      id: 4
      name: "MP"
      stats:
        atk: 100
        def: 100
        hp: 100
        mp: 100
        spd: 100

    - description: "An enemy with a high speed stat."
      id: 5
      name: "SPD"
      stats:
        atk: 100
        def: 100
        hp: 100
        mp: 100
        spd: 100
```

This way, you have an array of enemies with distinct descriptions.
