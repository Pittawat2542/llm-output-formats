The issue with the original YAML data was a duplicate `name` field. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: A dragon.
    id: 1
    name: Dragon
    stats:
      atk: 20
      def: 20
      hp: 20
      mp: 20
      spd: 20
```
The corrected YAML maintains the same structure and values, but I renamed `name` from "A dragon." to "Dragon" to avoid confusion.
