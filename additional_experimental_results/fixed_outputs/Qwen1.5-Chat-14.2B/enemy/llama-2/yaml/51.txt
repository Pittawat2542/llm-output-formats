```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "The enemy has a description."
    id: 1
    name: "The enemy has a name."
    stats:
      atk: 10
      def: 10
      hp: 10
      mp: 10
      spd: 10
```
All the examples provided had an incorrect syntax due to single quotes surrounding the description and name strings. I have replaced them with double quotes, which are the correct syntax for string values in YAML.
