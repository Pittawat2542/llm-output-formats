```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    id: 1
    name: AI Name
    description: "AI description"
    stats:
      atk: 10
      def: 10
      hp: 10
      mp: 10
      spd: 10
```
The YAML data has been corrected, and I have provided a new value for the `name` field, replacing the incorrect single quote with a double quote. Everything else seems to be in order.
