The issue was a stray backtick (`) character at the beginning of the YAML. I've removed it, and here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 100
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100
```

Now, the YAML syntax is correct, and it matches the provided template with default values for `atk`, `def`, `hp`, `mp`, and `spd`.
