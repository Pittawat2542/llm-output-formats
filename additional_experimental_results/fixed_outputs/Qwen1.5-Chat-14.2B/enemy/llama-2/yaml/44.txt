The YAML data provided is already correct and doesn't need any changes. Here's the fixed output:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: 10
      def: 10
      hp: 10
      mp: 10
      spd: 10
```

If you intended to provide default values for the int values, you can add them like this:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: 10
      def: 10
      hp: 10
      mp: 10
      spd: 10
```

But since there's no mention of specific default values, the current format is correct.
