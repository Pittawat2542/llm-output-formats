The issue with the provided YAML data is that it uses a backtick (`) instead of quotes (") for string values. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "A random enemy"
    id: 1
    name: "A random enemy"
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 100
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100
```

The example with only the YAML in a code block:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "A random enemy"
    id: 1
    name: "A random enemy"
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 100
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100
```
