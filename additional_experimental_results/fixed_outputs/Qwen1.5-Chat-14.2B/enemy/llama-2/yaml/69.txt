The issue with the original YAML data is that there's a single backtick (`) at the end of the `id` value. This character is not valid in YAML, and it should be removed to fix the syntax. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "A big, green, spiky, ball."
    id: "00000000000000000000000000000000"
    name: "Big Green Spiky Ball"
    stats:
      atk: 50
      def: 50
      hp: 50
      mp: 50
      spd: 50
```
