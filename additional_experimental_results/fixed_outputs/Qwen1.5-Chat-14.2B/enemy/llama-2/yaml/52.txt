The error in the original YAML data is that it has an incorrect syntax with a stray backtick (`) at the end of the line. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: atk int value
      def: def int value
      hp: hp int value
      mp: mp int value
      spd: spd int value
```

The extra backtick has been removed, and the YAML is now in a valid format.
