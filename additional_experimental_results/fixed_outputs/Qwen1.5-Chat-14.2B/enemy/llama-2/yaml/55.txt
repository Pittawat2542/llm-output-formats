All the provided examples seem to have correct syntax. However, if you want to remove the potential issue with the single quote (`'`) that was mentioned in the error message and replace it with a double quote (`"`), you can do so for string values. Here's the corrected YAML data:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "description"
    id: "id"
    name: "name"
    stats:
      atk: atk int value
      def: def int value
      hp: hp int value
      mp: mp int value
      spd: spd int value
```

I've made the changes to the strings only, as other values don't require quotes. If there were no issues with single quotes in your original examples and you just need a formatted version with double quotes, this is it. If not, the original data is correct too.
