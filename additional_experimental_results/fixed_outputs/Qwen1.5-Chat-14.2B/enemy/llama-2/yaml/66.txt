The issue with the original YAML data is that there's a stray backtick (`) at the end, which isn't part of any valid syntax. I've removed it to fix the incorrect syntax. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: 100
      def: 100
      hp: 100
      mp: 100
      spd: 100
```

If you want to provide new values for the int values, you can do so like this:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "Description of the enemy"
    id: "ENEMY_ID_1"
    name: "Enemy Name"
    stats:
      atk: 250
      def: 150
      hp: 500
      mp: 300
      spd: 75
```
