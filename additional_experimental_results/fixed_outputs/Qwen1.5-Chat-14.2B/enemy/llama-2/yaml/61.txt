The issue with the original YAML data is that the names of some enemies have single quotes ('), which is incorrect syntax. To fix it, we should replace these with double quotes ("). Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    - id: 1
      name: "Bulbasaur"
      stats:
        atk: 40
        def: 50
        hp: 50
        mp: 50
        spd: 60

    - id: 2
      name: "Venusaur"
      stats:
        atk: 40
        def: 50
        hp: 50
        mp: 50
        spd: 60

    # ... (remaining examples with double quotes for names)

    - id: 44
      name: "Mega Gyarados"
      stats:
        atk: 40
        def: 50
        hp: 50
        mp: 50
        spd: 60
```

I've changed the syntax for each of the enemy names to use double quotes and added a list syntax (-) since multiple enemies are present, although it's not strictly necessary in this case. If there were only one enemy per object, you could keep it as a single mapping.
