The issue with the original YAML syntax is that there's a leading space before the first line, which is not allowed in YAML. Here's the corrected YAML data:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "description"
    id: "id"
    name: "name"
    stats:
      atk: !int atk_int_value
      def: !int def_int_value
      hp: !int hp_int_value
      mp: !int mp_int_value
      spd: !int spd_int_value
```

In this version, I've enclosed the string values in double quotes to make them clear that they are strings and added `!int` as a type indicator for integer values since YAML does not natively support type annotations. If you don't need to distinguish between string and integer types, you can remove the `!int`.
