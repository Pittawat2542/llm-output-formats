The original YAML data provided is already correct. There were no syntax errors indicated in the cases given. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: atk int value
      def: def int value
      hp: hp int value
      mp: mp int value
      spd: spd int value
```

If you want to replace the placeholder values with new ones, please provide them and I can update accordingly.
