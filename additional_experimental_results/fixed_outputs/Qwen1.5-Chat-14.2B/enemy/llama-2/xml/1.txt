Here is the corrected XML data:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
    <enemy id="1">
        <name>Boss</name>
        <description>The Boss is a powerful enemy with high HP and MP. It has a very high attack and defense.</description>
        <stats>
            <hp>200</hp>
            <mp>100</mp>
            <atk>20</atk>
            <def>20</def>
            <spd>10</spd>
        </stats>
    </enemy>
    
    <enemy id="2">
        <name>Miniboss</name>
        <description>The Miniboss is a powerful enemy with high HP and MP. It has a very high attack and defense.</description>
        <stats>
            <hp>150</hp>
            <mp>100</mp>
            <atk>15</atk>
            <def>15</def>
            <spd>10</spd>
        </stats>
    </enemy>
</game>
```

The changes made are:
- Encoded the XML with `UTF-8` to avoid potential issues.
- Closed the `<stats>` tag properly.
- Added a closing `</enemy>` tag after each `<enemy>` element.
