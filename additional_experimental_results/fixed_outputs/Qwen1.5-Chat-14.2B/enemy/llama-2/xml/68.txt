The issue with the original XML data was that the closing `</stats>` tag was not properly indented, causing an incorrect syntax. Here's the corrected XML:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<enemy>
		<id>id</id>
		<name>name</name>
		<description>description</description>
		<stats>
			<hp>100</hp>
			<mp>100</mp>
			<atk>100</atk>
			<def>100</def>
			<spd>100</spd>
		</stats>
	</enemy>
</game>
```

I've also added the `encoding` attribute to the XML declaration, which is commonly used.
