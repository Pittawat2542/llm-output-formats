```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?> 
<game>
	<enemy>
		<id>id</id>
		<name>name</name>
		<description>description</description>
		<stats>
			<hp>hp int value</hp>
			<mp>mp int value</mp>
			<atk>atk int value</atk>
			<def>def int value</def>
			<spd>spd int value</spd>
		</stats>
	</enemy>
</game>
```

The issue with the original XML was that there was a missing closing tag for the `<stats>` element. I have corrected it now, and removed the extra whitespace before the `</stats>` line. If you want to include specific values for the stats, please provide them in place of "int value".
