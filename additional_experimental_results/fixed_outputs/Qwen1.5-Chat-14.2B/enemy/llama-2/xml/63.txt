```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
    <enemy>
        <id>id</id>
        <name>name</name>
        <description>description</description>
        <stats>
            <hp>100</hp>
            <mp>100</mp>
            <atk>100</atk>
            <def>100</def>
            <spd>100</spd>
        </stats>
    </enemy>
</game>
```

I have fixed the XML syntax by adding a `encoding="UTF-8"` attribute to the `<?xml version="1.0" ?>` declaration, which is commonly used. The closing `</stats>` tag was also correctly placed after the last child element `<spd>`. Additionally, I provided new values for the `hp`, `mp`, `atk`, `def`, and `spd` elements as per the example provided, although you can replace these with any desired integer values if needed.
