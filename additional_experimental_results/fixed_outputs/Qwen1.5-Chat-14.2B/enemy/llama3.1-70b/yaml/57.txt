The issue in the original YAML data is that the numeric values for `id` and the stats properties are using single quotes ('), which is not correct syntax for YAML. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: 14
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: 31
      def: 16
      hp: 67
      mp: 11
      spd: 7
```

In this version, I've replaced the single quotes with no quotes for the `id` value since it is a numeric value. The rest of the properties are fine as strings.
