```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "Definition of enemy"
    id: some_id
    name: enemy_name
    stats:
      atk: atk_value
      def: def_value
      hp: hp_value
      mp: mp_value
      spd: spd_value
```
The original YAML data had a syntax error because the `-` indicator for list items was used inside the `enemy` mapping, which is not allowed. I've fixed it by removing the `-` and placing the enemy properties under the `stats` dictionary. Also, I've added placeholder values for some attributes (`some_id`, `enemy_name`, `atk_value`, etc.). If you want to provide specific values, replace these placeholders accordingly.
