The original YAML data is correct, there was no syntax error. Here's the corrected YAML in a code block:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "enemy description"
    id: 1
    name: "enemy name"
    stats:
      atk: 5
      def: 2
      hp: 80
      mp: 5
      spd: 2
```

The provided template and the original data are for an `enemy`, not an `ally`. If you meant to correct the `ally` instead, please let me know.
