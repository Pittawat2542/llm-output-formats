The issue is that you cannot have an array directly under the `Enemy: Stats` key. It should be a nested object with properties as keys and values. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk:
        value: # of attack actions
      def:
        value: # of defense actions
      hp:
        value: # of health points
      mp:
        value: # of mana points
      spd:
        value: # of speed
```

Make sure to replace `description`, `id`, `name`, and the values in the `stats` section with appropriate string or integer values as needed.
