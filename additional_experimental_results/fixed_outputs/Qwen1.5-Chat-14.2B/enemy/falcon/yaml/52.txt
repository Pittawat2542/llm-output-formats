The issue with the original YAML data is that it starts with a list (-) instead of a dictionary. To fix this, we need to remove the dash and make the "game" key at the root level. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: atk int value
      def: def int value
      hp: hp int value
      mp: mp int value
      spd: spd int value
```

This YAML is now correct and represents a dictionary with the "game" key containing an "enemy" object.
