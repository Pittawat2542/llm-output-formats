The issue with the original YAML data is that it contains a syntax error, specifically an unnecessary backtick (`) character. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
output:
  game:
    enemy:
      id: # enemy id
      name: # enemy name
      stats:
        atk: 0
        def: 1 %d
        hp: 10000
        mp: 1000 -20
        spd: 50
      statset:
        -
          type: spell set
          list:
            - spell1
            - spell2
            - spell3
        -
        -
      mana:
        default: 10000
```

I removed the unnecessary backtick after "def" and fixed the indentation for "statset". The YAML is now valid.
