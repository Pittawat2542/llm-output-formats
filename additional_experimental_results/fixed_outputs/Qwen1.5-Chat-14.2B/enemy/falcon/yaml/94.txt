The issue in the provided YAML is that a table-like structure is being used, but YAML doesn't support this syntax. To fix it, we can remove the table-like formatting and adjust the content to follow proper YAML indentation.

Here's the fixed YAML:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: atk int value
      def: def int value
      hp: hp int value
      mp: mp int value
      spd: spd int value
```

The fixed YAML block represents the template without any errors.
