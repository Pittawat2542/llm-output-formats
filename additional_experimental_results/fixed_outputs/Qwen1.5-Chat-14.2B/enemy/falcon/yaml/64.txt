Here's the corrected YAML syntax with added missing values for `description`, `id`, and default stats. I've also provided the requested stats as an example, but you can replace them with actual values.

```yaml
# In-game stats

game:
  enemy:
    description: "Description of the enemy"
    id: ENEMY_1
    name: Enemy
    stats:
      atk: 120
      def: 80
      hp: 150
      mp: 100
      spd: 25
```

```yaml (output)
# In-game stats

game:
  enemy:
    description: "Description of the enemy"
    id: ENEMY_1
    name: Enemy
    stats:
      atk: 120
      def: 80
      hp: 150
      mp: 100
      spd: 25
```
