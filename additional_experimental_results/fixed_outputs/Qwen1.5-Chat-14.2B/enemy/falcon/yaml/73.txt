The original YAML data has some syntax errors and needs to be structured correctly as a dictionary. Here is the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "<description>"
    id: "<id>"
    name: "<name>"
    stats:
      atk: <atk int value>
      def: <def int value>
      hp: <hp int value>
      mp: <mp int value>
      spd: <spd int value>
```

Replace `<description>`, `<id>`, `<name>`, `<atk>`, `<def>`, `<hp>`, `<mp>`, and `<spd>` with the actual values you want to use.
