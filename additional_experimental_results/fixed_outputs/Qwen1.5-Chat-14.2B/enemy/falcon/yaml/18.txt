The issue with the original YAML is that it has a leading `~` symbol before the `enemy:` key, which is not valid syntax. I have removed it and fixed the indentation for the `description` field. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: [description]
    id: [id]
    name: [name]
    stats:
      atk: [atk]
      def: [def]
      hp: [hp]
      mp: [mp]
      spd: [spd]
```

Now, the YAML is in correct syntax.
