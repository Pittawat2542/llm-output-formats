The issue with the original YAML data is that `atk` value should not be inside the `stats` block as it has an arithmetic expression. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: id
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: 0.2 * # Remove the parenthesis and add space after 0.2 for correct interpretation
      def: 0
      hp: 800
      mp: 40
      spd: 0
```

The fixed YAML now correctly separates the `atk` value from the `stats` mapping, allowing it to be an independent key-value pair.
