```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
    <enemy id="id">
        <name>name</name>
        <description>description</description>
        <stats>
            <hp>hp int value</hp>
            <mp>mp int value</mp>
            <atk>atk int value</atk>
            <def>def int value</def>
            <spd>spd int value</spd>
        </stats>
    </enemy>
</game>
```
In the provided XML, there were a few issues:

1. The `<?xml version="1.0" ?>` tag was missing an attribute, like `encoding`. I added `"UTF-8"` as it's common.
2. The opening `<enemy>` tag in the first example had no attributes but had content immediately after it. In the fixed XML, I removed the redundant content and kept only the attribute-value pairs.
3. There was a closing `</stats>` before the end of the `<enemy>` element in the second example. This has been corrected by moving it to its proper location.

Now the XML is valid and follows the template structure.
