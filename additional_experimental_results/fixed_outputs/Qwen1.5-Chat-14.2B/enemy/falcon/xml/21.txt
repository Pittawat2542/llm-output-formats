The original XML data provided is not well-formed, as it contains HTML-like tags and does not follow the standard XML syntax. Here's a corrected version based on the template provided:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
  <enemy>
    <id>id</id>
    <name>name</name>
    <description>description</description>
    <stats>
      <hp>100</hp>
      <mp>50</mp>
      <atk>+1</atk>
      <def>25</def>
      <spd>0</spd>
    </stats>
  </enemy>
</game>
```

The values for `hp`, `mp`, `atk`, and `def` have been replaced with numeric or symbolic values, as per the original message. The `<stats>` element now closes properly, and the HTML-like formatting has been removed. If you need to provide specific values, replace `id`, `name`, `description`, and the numeric values accordingly.
