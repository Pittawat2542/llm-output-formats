The issue with the original XML data was that the closing `</stats>` tag was not properly indented and there was an extra space at the end of the line. Here's the corrected version:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
    <enemy>
        <id>id</id>
        <name>name</name>
        <description>description</description>
        <stats>
            <hp>hp int value</hp>
            <mp>mp int value</mp>
            <atk>atk int value</atk>
            <def>def int value</def>
            <spd>spd int value</spd>
        </stats>
    </enemy>
</game>
```

The `encoding` attribute has been added to the XML declaration for better compatibility, and the closing `</stats>` tag is now properly indented.
