The original XML data provided is not incorrect. It appears to be a valid snippet within the given template. If you want to include it in its entirety as part of the `game` element, here's the corrected XML:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<enemy>
		<id>id</id>
		<name>name</name>
		<description>description</description>
		<stats>
			<hp>100</hp>
			<mp>50</mp>
			<atk>100</atk>
			<def>50</def>
			<spd>150</spd>
		</stats>
	</enemy>
</game>
```

If you intended to provide the entire `game` element with multiple `enemy` instances, please let me know and I can modify it accordingly.
