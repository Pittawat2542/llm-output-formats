The original YAML data is already correct and formatted according to your preferences. Here it is in the requested format:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: description
    id: 1
    name: name
    stats:
      atk: 1
      def: 1
      hp: 1
      mp: 1
      spd: 1
```

The error you mentioned was due to a stray backtick (`) character, which is not present in the provided YAML.
