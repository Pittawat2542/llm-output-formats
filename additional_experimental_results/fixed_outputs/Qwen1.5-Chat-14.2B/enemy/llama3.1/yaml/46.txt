The error is caused by a single quote (`'`) in the `description` field, which needs to be enclosed in double quotes (`"`) for valid YAML syntax. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: "Goblin Scout"
    id: 1
    name: Goblin Scout
    stats:
      atk: 12
      def: 8
      hp: 25
      mp: 0
      spd: 4
```

If you want to include another enemy, you can add a new entry like this:

```yaml
game:
  enemies:
  - description: "Goblin Scout"
    id: 1
    name: Goblin Scout
    stats:
      atk: 12
      def: 8
      hp: 25
      mp: 0
      spd: 4
  - description: "Troll"
    id: 2
    name: Troll
    stats:
      atk: 20
      def: 14
      hp: 60
      mp: 0
      spd: 6
```
