Here's the corrected XML data:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
    <character>
        <id>CH001</id>
        <first-name>Eira</first-name>
        <last-name>Shadowglow</last-name>
        <species>HALF-ELF</species>
        <age>250 years old (appears to be mid-30s)</age>
        <role>Rogue/Assassin</role>
        <background>Eira was born in a small village on the edge of a vast forest, where she was trained by her elven mother in the art of stealth and deception. She later honed her skills as an assassin in a prestigious guild.</background>
        <place-of-birth>Elvanar Forest, Silverleaf Village</place-of-birth>
        <physical-appearance>
            <eye-color>Emerald Green</eye-color>
            <hair-color>DARK_BROWN_WITH_SUBTLE_RED_HIGHLIGHTS</hair-color>
            <height>5.8</height>
            <weight>120.5</weight>
        </physical-appearance>
    </character>
</game>
```

The changes made are:
1. Added `encoding="UTF-8"` attribute to the XML declaration for better compatibility.
2. Fixed the `<species>` element by removing the extra opening tag, as it should not be nested within another `<physical-appearance>`.
