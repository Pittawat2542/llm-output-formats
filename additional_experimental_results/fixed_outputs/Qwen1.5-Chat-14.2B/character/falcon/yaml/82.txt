The provided YAML data has been corrected to include the character's details as an array under the `character` key. I've added first name, last name, background, and other relevant attributes. Since some information was given in prose, it was restructured into more structured YAML fields. If you have specific values for height and weight that are already in a different format, please provide them accordingly.
