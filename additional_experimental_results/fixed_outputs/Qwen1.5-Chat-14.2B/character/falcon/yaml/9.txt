```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: "exact age or description"
    background: "background story"
    first_name: "first name"
    id: "id"
    last_name: "last name"
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: "eye color"
      hair_color: "hair color"
      height: 1.85 (or a float value if not exact)
      weight: 70.5 (or a float value if not exact)
    place_of_birth: "location"
    role: "role of the character"
    species: "species"
```
The incorrect syntax was caused by having single quotes around some values, which is not valid in YAML. I've replaced them with double quotes to maintain the correct formatting. Float values have been provided for height and weight as examples; please replace them with the actual float values if needed.
