The original YAML data has some issues with indentation and incorrect key-value pairs. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: exact age or description
    background:
      story: The character was born into a family of powerful wizards.
      id: optional unique identifier (string)
    first_name: first name (string)
    last_name: last name (string)
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: eye color (string)
      - hair_color: hair color (string)
      height: 1.85  # height in meters as a float
      weight: 70.5  # weight in kilograms as a float
    place_of_birth: location
    role: role of the character
    species: species
```

The changes made are:
- Enclosed `background story` under a nested key `story`.
- Added an optional `id` with string type.
- Fixed height and weight to be floats, converting them from meters to kilometers for height (1.85) and grams to kilograms for weight (70.5).
