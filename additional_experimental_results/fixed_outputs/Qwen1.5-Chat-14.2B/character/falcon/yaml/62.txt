The original YAML seems to have a typo in the `hair_color` key. It should reference `data-color_hair_color`, not just `data-color`. Apart from that, the structure looks correct. Here's the fixed YAML:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: exact age or description
    background: background story
    first_name: first name if provided
    id: id of the character
    last_name: last name
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: eye color
        hair_color: data-color_hair_color
        height: 1.85  # assuming a float value, replace with actual value if needed
        weight: 70.5   # assuming a float value, replace with actual value if needed
    place_of_birth: location
    role: role of the character
    species: species
```

The commented out `height` and `weight` values can be replaced with actual float numbers as needed.
