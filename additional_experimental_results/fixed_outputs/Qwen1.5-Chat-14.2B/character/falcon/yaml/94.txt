The original YAML data had multiple `id` keys for the `name` section, which is incorrect syntax. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
character:
  name:
    id: a unique character ID
    age: exact age or description
    background: background story
    first_name: first name
    last_name: last name
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: eye color `(e.g. `eye_color: green`)`
        hair_color: hair color
      height: height in float value
      weight: weight in float value
```

Note that I removed the duplicate `id` key and added a comment for clarification on how to format the `eye_color` entry.
