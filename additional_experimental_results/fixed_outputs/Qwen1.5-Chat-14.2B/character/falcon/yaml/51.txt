The issue with the provided YAML data is that it's not a proper dictionary; instead, it appears to be an attempt at accessing a nested property directly. To fix this, we need to create a dictionary structure and then assign the value for `character.age`.

Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: "exact age or description"
    background: "background story"
    first_name: "first name"
    id: "id"
    last_name: "last name"
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: "eye color"
        hair_color: "hair color"
        height: 1.80
        weight: 75.0
    place_of_birth: "location"
    role: "role of the character"
    species: "species"
```

I've provided default values for `height` and `weight` as floats, but you can replace them with actual values as needed.
