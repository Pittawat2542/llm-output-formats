The YAML syntax issue was in the `physical_appearance` key. It should not contain an array nested within it since it is expecting a list of properties. Here's the corrected YAML data with values for age and place_of_birth added as an example:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    name: # characters
    - First name: John Doe
      id: first_name
      type: string
      example: John
    - Last name: Doe
      id: last_name
      type: string
      example: Doe
    age:
      value: 30
    place_of_birth: San Francisco
    physical_appearance:
    - eye_color: Blue
    - hair_color: Brown
    - height: '5\'10"'
    - weight: 120lbs
```

This is the fixed YAML in a Markdown code block:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    First name: John Doe
    Last name: Doe
    age:
      value: 30
    place_of_birth: San Francisco
    physical_appearance:
    - eye_color: Blue
    - hair_color: Brown
    - height: '5\'10"'
    - weight: 120lbs
```
