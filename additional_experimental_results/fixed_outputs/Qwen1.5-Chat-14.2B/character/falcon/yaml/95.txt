The provided YAML data is missing a key-value pair for the `age` property under the `character` object. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
Game:
  character:
    age: "exact age or description" # Added the age value in quotes
    background: "background story"
    first_name: "first name"
    id: "id"
    last_name: "last name"
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: 0.5 (blue)
      hair_color: 0.5 (white)
      height: 1.4 (5'8")
      weight: 135 pounds
    place_of_birth: "Somewhere in the UK" # Added quotes around the location
    role: Hunter, Explorer, Spy
    species:
      - Fae: Fairy # Corrected the structure of the species key-value pair
  Organization:
    Order_of_the_Peacanauts
```
The fixed YAML now has the correct syntax and includes all the provided values.
