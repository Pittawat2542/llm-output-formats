Here's the corrected XML data with proper syntax and values for the elements:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
    <character id="ID123">
        <first-name>John</first-name>
        <last-name>Doe</last-name>
        <species>Human</species>
        <age>35</age>
        <role>Hero</role>
        <background>A former soldier, now a protector of the realm.</background>
        <place-of-birth>New York City</place-of-birth>
        <physical-appearance>
            <eye-color>Brown</eye-color>
            <hair-color>Blonde</hair-color>
            <height>1.85</height>
            <weight>75.0</weight>
        </physical-appearance>
    </character>
</game>
```

The original message had missing closing tags and some formatting issues, which I have fixed. The character now has a unique ID (`ID123`), proper names, and numeric values for height and weight.
