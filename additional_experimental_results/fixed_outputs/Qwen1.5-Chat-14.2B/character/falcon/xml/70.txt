The XML data provided was almost correct, but there was a small syntax error. The closing `</physical-appearance>` tag was not properly indented, which caused the issue. I've corrected it for you. Here's the fixed XML code:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
    <character>
        <id>id</id>
        <first-name>first name</first-name>
        <last-name>last name</last-name>
        <species>species</species>
        <age>exact age or description</age>
        <role>role of the character</role>
        <background>background story</background>
        <place-of-birth>location</place-of-birth>
        <physical-appearance>
            <eye-color>eye color</eye-color>
            <hair-color>hair color</hair-color>
            <height>height in float value</height>
            <weight>weight in float value</weight>
        </physical-appearance>
    </character>
</game>
```

X-Axis and Y-Axis (assuming you want to include these as attributes or elements, but they're not clear from the original context):

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
    <character x-axis="value1" y-axis="value2">
        <!-- rest of the character tags -->
    </character>
</game>
```

Replace `value1` and `value2` with appropriate values if needed.
