In the provided XML data, I've made the following changes:

1. Added `encoding="UTF-8"` to the XML prolog for better compatibility.
2. Fixed the nested `<physical-appearance>` tag by removing the extra opening tag and closing it properly.
3. Provided values for `eye-color`, `hair-color`, `height`, and `weight` as examples. You can replace these with actual values if needed.
