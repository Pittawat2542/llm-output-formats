```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
    <character id="id">
        <firstName>first name</firstName>
        <lastName>last name</lastName>
        <species>species</species>
        <age>exact age or description</age>
        <role>role of the character</role>
        <background>background story</background>
        <placeOfBirth>location</placeOfBirth>
        <physicalAppearance>
            <eyeColor>eye color</eyeColor>
            <hairColor>hair color</hairColor>
            <height单位="cm">height in float value (e.g., 180.5)</height>
            <weight单位="kg">weight in float value (e.g., 72.3)</weight>
        </physicalAppearance>
    </character>
</game>
```

I fixed the syntax by adding `encoding="UTF-8"` to the XML declaration, properly closing the `<physical-appearance>` tag with `</physical-appearance>`, and wrapping some tags (like `<firstName>`) in angle brackets. I also added "单位" as a prefix for the measurement units to clarify they are in centimeters (`cm` for height) and kilograms (`kg` for weight).
