I have made the following corrections:
1. Removed `<!DOCTYPE characterReport>` as it's not needed in this context.
2. Added `"UTF-8"` to the XML version attribute for encoding consistency.
3. Fixed the syntax error around `<place-of-birth>`, removed the style attribute and added `location` inside `<place-of-birth>`.
4. Added `units="cm"` and `units="kg"` attributes to `<height>` and `<weight>` respectively, to specify the units of measurement.
