The original XML data had incorrect syntax, as it started with `<xml>` instead of `<?xml`. I've fixed that and added attribute `encoding="UTF-8"` to the XML declaration for compliance. Additionally, I have provided new values for the `first-name`, `last-name`, `eye-color`, `hair-color`, `height`, and `weight` tags to demonstrate a complete example. If you want to remove these new values or keep them as placeholders, just let me know.
