The XML has been corrected by changing "Name" to "firstName" and "LastName" (with capitalization) for consistency, adding the missing "encoding" attribute to the XML declaration, and fixing the syntax around `<Height>` and `<Weight>`. The `ft` and `lbs` units have also been added within angle brackets for clarity.
