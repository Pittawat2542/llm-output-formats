The original XML data provided is already correct, apart from the missing closing `</physical-appearance>` tag within the `<character>` element. Here's the fixed version:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<character id="id" first-name="first name" last-name="last name" species="species" age="exact age or description" role="role of the character" background="background story" place-of-birth="location">
		<physical-appearance>
			<eye-color>eye color</eye-color>
			<hair-color>hair color</hair-color>
			<height>height in float value</height>
			<weight>weight in float value</weight>
		</physical-appearance>
	</character>
</game>
```

I added the `encoding="UTF-8"` attribute to the XML declaration for clarity, and closed the `<physical-appearance>` tag properly.
