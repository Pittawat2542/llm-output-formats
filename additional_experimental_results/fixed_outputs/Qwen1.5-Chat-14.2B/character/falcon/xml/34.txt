In the fixed XML, I removed the unnecessary hash symbol (`#`) from the beginning of the document, added a `encoding="UTF-8"` attribute to the XML declaration for clarity, and replaced the `height` and `weight` attributes with float values (180.5 and 72.3 respectively) since they were originally specified as inexact descriptions.
