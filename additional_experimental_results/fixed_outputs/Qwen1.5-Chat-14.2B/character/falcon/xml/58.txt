```
In the fixed XML, I've removed the incorrect nested `<physical-appearance>` tags and added attributes to the `<height>` and `<weight>` elements for specifying their values and units. Additionally, I changed `parseFloat` calls to actual value assignments (e.g., `180.5`) and replaced them with appropriate units. The rest of the XML structure remains as intended from the original template.
