The YAML data provided is already correct, according to the specification you mentioned. Here's the corrected YAML code block:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 25
    background: "was raised in the slums of the city"
    first_name: John
    id: 123
    last_name: Smith
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: green
        hair_color: brown
        height: 5'10"
        weight: 160.0
    place_of_birth: Earth
    role: police officer
    species: human
```

The only change I made was to enclose the background story in double quotes since it contains a string without a specific data type like an age or a float value. The height value is also converted to a float (160.0) to maintain consistency with other numerical values.
