All the provided examples have the same issue, which is a string representation for the age and background values instead of YAML scalars. To fix this, we need to remove the quotes around those values. Here's the corrected YAML for all the examples:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 23
    background: 23 years old
    first_name: John
    id: 1
    last_name: Doe
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: blue
        hair_color: blonde
        height: 1.75
        weight: 75
    place_of_birth: New York
    role: detective
    species: human
```

I've removed the quotes around `23` and `23 years old`. If you want to provide a description for the age in future, it should be inside quotes as a string. The rest of the structure is correct.
