The issue with the provided YAML data is that there is a line break (`\n`) before the closing `]` of the `physical_appearance` list, which is not allowed in YAML. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: exact age or description
    background: background story
    first_name: first name
    id: id
    last_name: last name
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: eye color
        hair_color: hair color
        height: float value (replace with a number)
        weight: float value (replace with a number)
    place_of_birth: location
    role: role of the character
    species: species
```

I removed the line break and added that `height` and `weight` should be float values, not just `float value`. If you want to keep the `description` for `age`, it should look like this:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: description of the exact age or
    ...
```

Let me know if you need help with specific values or further changes.
