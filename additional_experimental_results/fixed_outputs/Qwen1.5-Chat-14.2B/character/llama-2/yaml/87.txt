The original YAML data provided does not have any syntax errors. The structure is correct, and the values are within the allowed format for YAML. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 30
    background: "I am a gamer"
    first_name: Harry
    id: 1
    last_name: Potter
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: brown
        hair_color: brown
        height: 173.0
        weight: 70.0
    place_of_birth: London
    role: Student
    species: human
```

I removed the single quotes around the string `I am a gamer` and changed `height` and `weight` from integers to float values by adding `.0`.
