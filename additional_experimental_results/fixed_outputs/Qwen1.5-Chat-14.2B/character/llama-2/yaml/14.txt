The issue with the original YAML data is that it has an incorrect indentation for the `physical_appearance` key. The correct syntax should have a dash `-` and then a colon `:` after each item in the list. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 24
    background: "Jason was born in a small town in the USA. He was raised by his mother and father, who were both farmers. Jason's mother was a strict disciplinarian, while his father was more laid-back. Jason was an average student in school, but he excelled in sports. After high school, he attended college on a football scholarship. He majored in business and graduated with honors."
