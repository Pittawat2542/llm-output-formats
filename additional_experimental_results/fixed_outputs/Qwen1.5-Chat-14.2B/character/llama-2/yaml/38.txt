The issue with the provided YAML data is that it has an incorrect indentation for the `physical_appearance` key. The value should be a list, but the dash `-` is not indented properly. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 21
    background: "The character is a student at the University of California, Berkeley."
    first_name: Alice
    id: 123456789
    last_name: Smith
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: blue
        hair_color: blonde
        height: 5'5"
        weight: 120 lbs
    place_of_birth: California
    role: Student
    species: Human
```

The indentation for the list items under `physical_appearance` has been fixed to a tab or four spaces.
