The issue with the provided YAML data is that you have a string with an apostrophe (`'`) in it, which should be escaped since it's not part of a regular key-value pair. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: "exact age or description"
    background: A bit of a loner, but has a good heart.
    first_name: Kara
    id: 123456
    last_name: Kane
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: brown
        hair_color: black
        height: 5.4
        weight: 100 lb
    place_of_birth: Earth
    role: Security Officer
    species: Human
```
The apostrophe in "exact age or description" has been replaced with `"` to indicate that it is a string value, and the float value for height has been modified to `5.4` to remove the single quote.
