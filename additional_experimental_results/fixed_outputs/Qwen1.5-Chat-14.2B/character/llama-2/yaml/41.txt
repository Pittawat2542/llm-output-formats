The issue with the original YAML data is that there's a trailing ` in one of the examples. I've removed it, and here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 20
    background: The character is a veteran of the war.
    first_name: John
    id: 0123456789
    last_name: Doe
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: blue
        hair_color: blonde
        height: 1.80
        weight: 80
    place_of_birth: New York
    role: The character is a veteran of the war.
    species: human

# Remove the trailing ` in the following examples if they are not intended to be separate documents
```

If you meant for each example to be a separate document, you would need to enclose them with three dashes (`---`) at the beginning and end, like this:

```yaml
---
game:
  character:
    age: 20
    background: The character is a veteran of the war.
    first_name: John
    id: 0123456789
    last_name: Doe
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: blue
        hair_color: blonde
        height: 1.80
        weight: 80
    place_of_birth: New York
    role: The character is a veteran of the war.
    species: human

...

Please let me know if you need the single document version or separate ones.
