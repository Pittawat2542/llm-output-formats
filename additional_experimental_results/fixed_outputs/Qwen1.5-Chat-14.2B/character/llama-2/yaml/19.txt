The provided YAML data is correct and doesn't have any syntax issues. Here it is in a code block:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 22
    background: "background story"
    first_name: "first name"
    id: "id"
    last_name: "last name"
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: "eye color"
      - hair_color: "hair color"
      - height: 1.85 # assuming float value in meters
      - weight: 70.5 # assuming float value in kilograms
    place_of_birth: location
    role: "role of the character"
    species: "species"
```

There were minor adjustments to string values, like enclosing them in double quotes (`"`) to comply with YAML syntax rules for strings.
