There is no syntax error in the provided YAML data. It is correct and can be used as-is. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 18
    background: "The character has a tough background"
    first_name: "Jane"
    id: "123"
    last_name: "Doe"
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: blue
        hair_color: blonde
        height: 5.5
        weight: 110
    place_of_birth: "New York"
    role: "The character is a police officer"
    species: "human"

game:
  character:
    age: 23
    background: "The character is a student"
    first_name: "John"
    id: "456"
    last_name: "Smith"
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: blue
        hair_color: brown
        height: 6.1
        weight: 180
    place_of_birth: "New York"
    role: "The character is a police officer"
    species: "human"
```

Please note that the `height` values in the `physical_appearance` are formatted using float notation with a decimal point (5.5 for Example 1 and 6.1 for Example 2). If you prefer to use feet and inches, it would look like this:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 18
    background: "The character has a tough background"
    first_name: "Jane"
    id: "123"
