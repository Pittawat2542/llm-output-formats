Here is the corrected YAML data:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 20
    background: orphan
    first_name: John
    id: 23
    last_name: Doe
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: brown
        hair_color: brown
        height: 1.7
        weight: 70.0 # Added ".0" for float value
    place_of_birth: Earth
    role: engineer
    species: human
```

The only change made was to add a decimal point in the `weight` value (70.0) as YAML requires float values to be explicitly represented with a `.`.
