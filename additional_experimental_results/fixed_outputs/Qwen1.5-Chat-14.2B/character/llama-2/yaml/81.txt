The issue with the provided YAML data is that it has an incorrect syntax because of the single backticks (`) around some keys. Backticks are typically used for inline code snippets, but they don't have a specific meaning in YAML. To fix this, remove the backticks and the quotes around `exact age or description` and `float value`. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: exact age or description
    background: a story about the character's past
    first_name: John
    id: 12345
    last_name: Smith
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: brown
        hair_color: black
        height: 180.0
        weight: 85.0
    place_of_birth: New York
    role: a character in a story
    species: human
```

If you want to keep the original values without explaining them, here's just the YAML code block:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 30
    background: a story about the character's past
    first_name: John
    id: 12345
    last_name: Smith
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: brown
        hair_color: black
        height: 180.0
        weight: 85.0
    place_of_birth: New York
    role: a character in a story
    species: human
```
