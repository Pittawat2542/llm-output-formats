The issue with the provided YAML data is that there are no indentation levels for some key-value pairs, which is required in YAML. Here's the corrected YAML format:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 25
    background: orphan
    first_name: Luna
    id: 1
    last_name: Luna
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: blue
        hair_color: brown
        height: 1.6
        weight: 50
    place_of_birth: Earth
    role: human
    species: human
```

All key-value pairs under `physical_appearance` have been indented with a single space, making the syntax correct.
