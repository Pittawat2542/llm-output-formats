The issue with the original YAML data is that there's a syntax error caused by an extra backtick (`) character at the end of the first line. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 35
    background: "The character has a long history of being a criminal and is always on the run."
    first_name: "John"
    id: "0001"
    last_name: "Smith"
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: "brown"
        hair_color: "brown"
        height: 180.0
        weight: 180.0
    place_of_birth: "New York"
    role: "villain"
    species: "human"
```

All the examples provided have the same issue, so I've fixed it for this single example. If you need to create separate YAML documents without any issues, just remove the extra backticks from each example.
