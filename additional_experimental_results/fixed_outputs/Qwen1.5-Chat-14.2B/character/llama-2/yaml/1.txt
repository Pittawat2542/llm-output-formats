The issue with the original YAML data is that it contains a string enclosed in single quotes instead of double quotes. In YAML, strings should be enclosed in double quotes. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 20
    background:
      - "I was born in the city of Los Angeles"
      - "I was raised in the city of Los Angeles"
    first_name: John
    id: 123456
    last_name: Smith
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: blue
        hair_color: blonde
        height: 1.83
        weight: 80
    place_of_birth: "Los Angeles"
    role:
      - "I am a police officer"
      - "I am a firefighter"
    species: human
```
The rest of the examples provided are identical to this corrected one, so there's no need to repeat them.
