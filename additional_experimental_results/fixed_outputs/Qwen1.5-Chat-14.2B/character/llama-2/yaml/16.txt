The issue with the original YAML data is that it has a single quote (`'`) instead of double quotes (`"`) around some keys and values. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: "28"
    background: "background story"
    first_name: "first name"
    id: "id"
    last_name: "last name"
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: "eye color"
        hair_color: "hair color"
        height: 170.0
        weight: 80.0
    place_of_birth: "location"
    role: "role of the character"
    species: "species"
```

The values for `height` and `weight` have been modified to include a `.0` to indicate that they are floating point numbers, as per YAML syntax.
