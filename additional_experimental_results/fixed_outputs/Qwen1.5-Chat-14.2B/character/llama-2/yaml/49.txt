The YAML data provided is correct and does not need any changes. Here's the corrected code block:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 20
    background: "I was born in a small town in the middle of nowhere."
    first_name: "John"
    id: 2
    last_name: "Doe"
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: blue
        hair_color: brown
        height: 180.0
        weight: 75.0
    place_of_birth: "Houston, Texas"
    role: "Main character"
    species: "Human"
```
Note that I have replaced the `float` values for `height` and `weight` with `180.0` and `75.0`, respectively, to ensure they are in float format as per YAML syntax requirements.
