The original YAML data provided does not have any syntax errors, aside from the unnecessary line breaks between some elements. Here's the corrected YAML code:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 32
    background: "The character is a 32 year old orphan who was raised by a family of wolves."
    first_name: Jim
    id: 1
    last_name: Jim
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: blue
        hair_color: brown
        height: 6.0
        weight: 160.0
    place_of_birth: Earth
    role: Scientist
    species: human
```

If you want to remove the unnecessary quotes around strings like "role" and "species", it would look like this:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 32
    background: The character is a 32 year old orphan who was raised by a family of wolves.
    first_name: Jim
    id: 1
    last_name: Jim
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: blue
        hair_color: brown
        height: 6.0
        weight: 160.0
    place_of_birth: Earth
    role: Scientist
    species: human
```

However, the original formatting with quotes is more consistent and does not cause issues.
