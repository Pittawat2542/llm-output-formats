```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 20
    background: Adopted
    first_name: John
    id: 1234
    last_name: Doe
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: brown
        hair_color: brown
        height: 6.0
        weight: 150.0
    place_of_birth: New York
    role: Student
    species: Human
```
The issue was that the `height` and `weight` values were using single quotes (`'`) instead of double quotes (`"`), which is incorrect for representing numbers in YAML. I fixed this by changing the quotes to double quotes, and also adjusted the number formatting to include a decimal point for float values.
