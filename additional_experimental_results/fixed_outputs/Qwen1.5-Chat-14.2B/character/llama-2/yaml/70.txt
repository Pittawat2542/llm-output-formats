The issue with the provided YAML data is that an extra leading zero in the character's `id` value was causing the syntax error. Here is the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 15
    background: "She's an orphan from the streets of New York."
    first_name: "Mary"
    id: "000000000000000000000000"
    last_name: "Jones"
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: "brown"
        hair_color: "black"
        height: 5.2
        weight: 110 lbs
    place_of_birth: "New York"
    role: "Sidekick"
    species: "Human"
```

The `height` value was also formatted as a float, so I removed the single quote around it.

Here's the YAML in code block format:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 15
    background: "She's an orphan from the streets of New York."
    first_name: "Mary"
    id: "0000000000000000"
    last_name: "Jones"
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: brown
        hair_color: black
        height: 5.2
        weight: 110 lbs
    place_of_birth: "New York"
    role: "Sidekick"
    species: Human
```
