The provided YAML data is correct and has no syntax issues. Here's the corrected YAML code block:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 18
    background: "The character was born in the city of Chicago."
    first_name: John
    id: 1
    last_name: Doe
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: blue
        hair_color: brown
        height: 180.0
        weight: 75.0
    place_of_birth: Chicago
    role: Student
    species: Human
```

The only change made is to enclose the string in the `background` key with double quotes since it contains a space, which is required for proper YAML formatting. The float values for `height` and `weight` are also corrected from integers to float format (180.0 and 75.0).
