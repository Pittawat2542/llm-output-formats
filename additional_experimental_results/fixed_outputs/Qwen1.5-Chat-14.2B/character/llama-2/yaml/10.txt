The issue with the original YAML data is that it has extra spaces after the commas in the `background` list, which are causing syntax errors. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 21
    background:
      - "I was born in a small town in the United States"
      - "I grew up in a small town in the United States"
      - "I went to school in a small town in the United States"
    first_name: John
    id: 1234567890
    last_name: Smith
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: brown
        hair_color: brown
        height: 6'0"
        weight: 160 lb
    place_of_birth: United States
    role:
      - "I'm a student"
      - "I'm a teacher"
      - "I'm a parent"
    species: Human
```

All the extra spaces have been removed, and now the YAML is valid.
