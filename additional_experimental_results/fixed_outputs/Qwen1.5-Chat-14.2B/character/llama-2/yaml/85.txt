The YAML data provided appears to be correct, with the exception that there are no indentation issues as mentioned in the error message. However, if you want a single code block without any examples repeating, I can provide the corrected and minimal template:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 18
    background: "I'm a student"
    first_name: "Mia"
    id: 1
    last_name: "Bond"
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: brown
        hair_color: blonde
        height: 160.0
        weight: 50.0
    place_of_birth: London
    role: agent
    species: human
```

Here, I changed the `height` and `weight` values from integers to floats with a decimal point (`.0`). This is a common practice in YAML to represent float numbers. If you prefer them as integers without decimal points, keep them as:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 18
    background: "I'm a student"
    first_name: "Mia"
    id: 1
    last_name: "Bond"
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: brown
        hair_color: blonde
        height: 160
        weight: 50
    place_of_birth: London
    role: agent
    species: human
```
