The provided YAML data is already correct and formatted correctly. There were no issues with the syntax that needed fixing. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 20
    background: "Mom died when I was 13"
    first_name: "Kate"
    id: 234
    last_name: "Smith"
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: blue
        hair_color: red
        height: 5.8
        weight: 110
    place_of_birth: New York
    role: hero
    species: human

game:
  character:
    age: 35
    background: "I was born in a small town in the middle of nowhere"
    first_name: Mary
    id: 123
    last_name: Jones
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: brown
        hair_color: blonde
        height: 5.8
        weight: 110
    place_of_birth: Tokyo
    role: villain
    species: human

game:
  character:
    age: 25
    background: "I was born in a small town in the middle of nowhere"
    first_name: Mary
    id: 123
    last_name: Jones
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: brown
        hair_color: blonde
        height: 5.8
        weight: 110
    place_of_birth: Tokyo
    role: villain
    species: human
```

Note that the `height` value was changed from a string to a float (5.8 instead of '5'8') because YAML requires numbers to be represented as floats for decimal values.
