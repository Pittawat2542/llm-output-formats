The issue with the original XML data was that there was a closing `</physical-appearance>` tag without an opening one. Here's the corrected XML:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
    <character>
        <id>id</id>
        <first-name>first name</first-name>
        <last-name>last name</last-name>
        <species>species</species>
        <age>exact age or description</age>
        <role>role of the character</role>
        <background>background story</background>
        <place-of-birth>location</place-of-birth>
        <physical-appearance>
            <eye-color>eye color</eye-color>
            <hair-color>hair color</hair-color>
            <height>1.78</height>
            <weight>75.0</weight>
        </physical-appearance>
    </character>
</game>
```

I've added the missing opening `<physical-appearance>` tag, closed it properly, and specified the encoding to "UTF-8" which is a common practice in XML documents. Now the XML should be well-formed and valid according to the error message provided.
