Note: I have made the following corrections:
1. Added `encoding="UTF-8"` to the XML declaration for consistency.
2. Corrected the syntax by adding closing tags and attributes where needed, such as `<place-of-birth(Location)>` and `<eye-color Eye Color>`.
3. Fixed the indentation for better readability.
