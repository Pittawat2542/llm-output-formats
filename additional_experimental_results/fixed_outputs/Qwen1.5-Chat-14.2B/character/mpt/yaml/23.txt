The issue with the original YAML data is that the `height` and `weight` keys should be represented as float values, not in string format. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 12
    background: "12 year old boy, lives in Gotham, very smart"
    first_name: Bruce
    id: 1234
    last_name: Wayne
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: blue
        hair_color: brown
        height: 6.0
        weight: 130.0
    place_of_birth: Gotham
    role: boy
    species: human
```

And for the extra credit part:

```yaml
extra_character_info:
  character:
    first_name: Bruce
    last_name: Wayne
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: blue
        hair_color: brown
        height: 6.0
        weight: 130.0
    role: boy
```

Here's the combined YAML:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: 12
    background: "12 year old boy, lives in Gotham, very smart"
    first_name: Bruce
    id: 1234
    last_name: Wayne
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: blue
        hair_color: brown
        height: 6.0
        weight: 130.0
    place_of_birth: Gotham
    role: boy
    species: human

extra_character_info:
  character:
    first_name: Bruce
    last_name: Wayne
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: blue
        hair_color: brown
        height: 6.0
        weight: 130.0
    role: boy
```
