The provided YAML data is correct, with the exception that `weight` should be a float value instead of in quotes. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  character:
    age: "23"
    background: "I'm an alien from planet Pteros."
    first_name: "Sam"
    id: "a32d0c9"
    last_name: "Winchester"
    physical_appearance:
      - eye_color: green
        hair_color: blonde
        height: 5.8
        weight: 130.0
    place_of_birth: "Epping Forest"
    role: "Assistant to the Doctor and Amy Pond"
    species: "Race of Gallifreyan"
```
