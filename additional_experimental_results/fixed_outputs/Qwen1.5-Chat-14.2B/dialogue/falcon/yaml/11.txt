The original YAML data is missing the indentation for the `dialogues` key and has an incorrect structure. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: order of game in the list
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
```
Now the syntax is correct, and I've added a placeholder value for `order`. If you want to provide specific values, replace `order of game in the list`, `speaker name`, and `dialogue or narration` with your desired values.
