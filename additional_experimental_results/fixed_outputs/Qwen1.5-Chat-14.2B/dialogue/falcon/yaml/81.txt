The issue with the provided YAML data is that it starts with an indentation, which indicates a block mapping instead of a document start. To fix this, remove the leading space before `order:` to make it a valid YAML structure. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
dialogues:
  - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text: dialogue or narration
```
The code block containing the fixed YAML is as follows:

```yaml
dialogues:
  - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text: dialogue or narration
```
