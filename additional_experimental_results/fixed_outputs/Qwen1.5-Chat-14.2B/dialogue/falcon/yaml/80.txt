The original YAML data is missing the required key 'game' and has an incorrect indentation for the 'dialogues' key. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: John
      text: |-
        John: Hi.
        Jane: Hey John.
        John: Thanks Jane!
```

I added the missing 'game:' at the beginning and fixed the indentation for the 'dialogues' list item.
