The original YAML data provided is incomplete as it only contains a single dialogue object without the required 'game' key. Here's the corrected YAML with the missing 'game' key and the existing dialogue:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
```

Now, the data is in correct YAML format with the specified template structure.
