The issue with the YAML syntax is that there's an extra hyphen `-` after the `order: dialogue order` in the first block mapping. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: the text of the conversation
    - order: order of the conversations
```

The YAML now has a single mapping for each dialogue, with the `-` removed from the first entry.
