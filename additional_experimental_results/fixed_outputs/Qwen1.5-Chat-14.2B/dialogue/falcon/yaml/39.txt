The issue was that there was a missing key for the `dialogues` list. I've added the necessary key `list` to fix the syntax. Here's the corrected YAML data:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
    - speaker: speaker name
    - text: dialogue or narration
```

The indentation has also been adjusted for proper formatting.
