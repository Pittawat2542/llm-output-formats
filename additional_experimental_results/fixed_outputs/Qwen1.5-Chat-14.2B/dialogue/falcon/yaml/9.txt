The original YAML data has incorrect syntax because of the backticks (`) around the key-value pairs in the first entry for `player1`. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
- player1:
   - speaker: @player1
     text: Hi, I'm here to play
   - order: :03
   - text: :03

- player2:
   - speaker: @player2
   - order: :01
   - text: Hey, I'm here too!
```

The values for `speaker` and `text` keys are now without backticks, and the YAML structure is fixed.
