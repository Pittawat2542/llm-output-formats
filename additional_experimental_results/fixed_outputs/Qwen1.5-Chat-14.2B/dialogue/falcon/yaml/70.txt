The original YAML data has a syntax error because it starts with `>` which is not valid in YAML. Here's the corrected version:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: User
    - key: text
      text: "I heard that we needed to hurry up."
```

The fix removes the extraneous leading `>`. The provided YAML is now valid and correctly structured.
