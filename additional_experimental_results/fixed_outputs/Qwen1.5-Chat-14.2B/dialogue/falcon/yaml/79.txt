The original message was enclosed in angle brackets, which are not valid in YAML. I removed them and added double quotes around the text to make it a valid scalar value within the `text` key. Additionally, I started the YAML with a dash (`-`) to indicate that this is an item in a list. The `#Output YAML` and `<output>` comments were also removed since they are not part of the YAML structure.
