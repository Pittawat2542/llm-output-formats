```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: "John"
      text: Welcome to the game. Have a great time!
    - order: 2
      speaker: "Jane"
      text: That sounds nice. Have fun with that!
```
The issue was with an extra set of curly braces `{}` after the `text` key in the second dialogue. I have removed them, and now the YAML is correct and formatted as expected.
