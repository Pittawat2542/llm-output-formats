The issue with the provided YAML data is that it's missing the root dictionary. Here's the corrected version:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: dialogue order
    speaker: Speaker Name
    text: Dialogue or narration
```

Note I added "Speaker Name" to the `speaker` key as it should contain a value and replaced "Other text or narration" with "Dialogue or narration", assuming this is what you want to include. If there's no specific speaker name, you can remove the value or replace it with an empty string.
