The issue with the original YAML data is that the `text` key should be a dictionary containing the `narrative` key, not another list. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker:
        name: speaker name
      text:
        narrative: "narrative text, for example (spoken), could be dialogue, narrations, etc."
```

Note that I removed the `,` from `text`, and added quotation marks around the `narrative` value to make it a string.
