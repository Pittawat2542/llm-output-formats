The issue with the original YAML was that there was an incorrect indentation and stray `^` character at the start of the line. I have removed the unnecessary indentation and added values for the `text` key in the `dialogues` list item. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: dialogue order
     speaker: speaker name
     text:
       type: quote
       quote: "Dialogue. And I quote a quote."
```
