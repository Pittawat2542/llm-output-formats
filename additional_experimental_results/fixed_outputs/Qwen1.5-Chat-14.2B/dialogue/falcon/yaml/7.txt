The original YAML data has incorrect indentation and missing the required structure for the 'game' key as specified in the template. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration

speaker:
  name: <name>
  text: <text>
```

Note that I've added the missing 'dialogues' key under the 'game' key and fixed the indentation for the list of dialogues. If you want to provide values for the specific keys, replace `<name>` and `<text>` with the desired values.
