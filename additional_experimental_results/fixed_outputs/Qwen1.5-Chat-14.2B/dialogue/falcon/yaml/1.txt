The issue is that the key "speaker" should be inside the "game" object, not at the root level. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  speaker:
    - name: character name
```
In-game dialogue code block (including the fixed YAML):
```
```python
# Example dialogue
return """\
game:
  speaker:
    - name: character name

"""
```
