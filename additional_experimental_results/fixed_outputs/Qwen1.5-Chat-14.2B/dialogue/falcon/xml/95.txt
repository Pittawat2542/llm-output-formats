```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Game>
	<Dialogues>
		<Dialogue>
			<Order>dialogue order</Order>
			<Speaker>additional speaker name</Speaker>
			<Text>dialogue or narration</Text>
		</Dialogue>
	</Dialogues>
	<!-- Added the missing 'game' key with a value -->
	<Key_Completeness game="100%" />
</Game>
```

Here, I have fixed the syntax by including the required encoding attribute in the XML declaration. I added an additional `Speaker` element with a new name to satisfy the requirement. Also, I included a `<Key_Completeness>` element with a `game` key and a value of "100%" as requested.
