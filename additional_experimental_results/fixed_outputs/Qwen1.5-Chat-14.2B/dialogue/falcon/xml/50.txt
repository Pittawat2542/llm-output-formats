Here is the corrected XML data:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>dialogue order</order>
			<speaker>speaker name</speaker>
			<text>dialogue or narration</text>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```

I removed the duplicate attribute and adjusted the structure to match the original template. The namespace declarations were also removed since they are not necessary for this example, and I added an `encoding` attribute to the XML declaration as is common practice.
