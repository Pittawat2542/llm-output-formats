Here's the corrected XML data with proper syntax:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
    <dialogues>
        <dialogue>
            <order>dialogue order</order>
            <speaker>speaker name</speaker>
            <text>dialogue or narration</text>
        </dialogue>
    </dialogues>
</game>
```

The original message had an incorrect XML declaration (`<!DOCTYPE markdown-enhanced>`) and was not in the correct format for a game with dialogues. I removed the `markdown-enhanced` declaration and adjusted the structure to match the provided template.
