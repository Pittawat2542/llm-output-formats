Here's the corrected XML data:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>dialogue order</order>
			<speaker>Jane Doe</speaker>
			<text>
				<p>John Doe is the leader of a special forces team who has been called in to help with a large-scale operation.</p>
			</text>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```

I removed the incorrect HTML tags (`<h3>` and `<h4>`) and replaced them with proper XML tags for dialogue and speaker. Also, I added `encoding="UTF-8"` to the XML declaration for consistency.
