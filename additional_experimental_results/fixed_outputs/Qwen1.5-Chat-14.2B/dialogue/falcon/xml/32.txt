The provided XML data is not well-formed and contains incorrect syntax, as it attempts to start elements with `{` and `}` instead of using the `<` and `>` tags. Here's the corrected version:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
    <dialogues>
        <dialogue>
            <order>dialogue order</order>
            <speaker>speaker name</speaker>
            <text><![CDATA[<dialogue or narration>]]></text>
        </dialogue>
    </dialogues>
</game>
```

Note that I removed the curly braces from around the `text` element and replaced the incorrect content with a valid CDATA section for dialogue content. If you want to provide new values for `order`, `speaker`, or `text`, replace those placeholders accordingly.
