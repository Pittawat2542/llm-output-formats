```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>dialogue order</order>
			<speaker>Speaker Name</speaker>
			<translation xml:space="preserve">Dialogue text or narration</translation>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```
The original XML had a closing `</dialogue>` tag with an extra forward slash, which caused the syntax error. I fixed it by removing the extra `/`. Additionally, I added the attribute `encoding="UTF-8"` to the XML declaration, and wrapped the dialogue text in a `<translation>` element with the `xml:space="preserve"` attribute to keep whitespace as intended.
