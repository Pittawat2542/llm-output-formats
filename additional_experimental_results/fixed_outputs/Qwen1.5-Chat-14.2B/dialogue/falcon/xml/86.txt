The XML data has been corrected and values have been added where needed. Here's the fixed XML:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
   <dialogues>
     <dialogue>
       <order>Dialogue 1</order>
       <speaker>Speaker A</speaker>
       <text>This is the first dialogue.</text>
     </dialogue>
     <dialogue>
       <order>Dialogue 2</order>
       <speaker>Speaker B</speaker>
       <text>The second dialogue continues...</text>
     </dialogue>
     <!-- Add more dialogues as needed -->
   </dialogues>
</game>
```

Please note that I've added the `encoding` attribute to the XML declaration and provided specific values for some elements (e.g., "Dialogue 1", "Speaker A") to make it a complete example. If you want to keep the original format with placeholder names, use the template from your question.
