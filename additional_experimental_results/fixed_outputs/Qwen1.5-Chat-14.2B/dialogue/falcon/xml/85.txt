```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
  <dialogues>
    <dialogue>
      <order>dialogue order</order>
      <speaker>speaker name</speaker>
      <text>dialogue or narration</text>
    </dialogue>
  </dialogues>
</game>
```
I have corrected the XML syntax, removed the incorrect `<xml>` tags, and added a `encoding="UTF-8"` attribute to the opening `<?xml` tag. The 'game' key was not mentioned in the original issue, so I kept the structure as it is with only the `<dialogue>` element corrected within the `<dialogues>` parent.
