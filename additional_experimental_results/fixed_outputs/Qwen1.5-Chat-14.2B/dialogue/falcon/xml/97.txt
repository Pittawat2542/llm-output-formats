The provided XML data has some syntax errors. Here's the corrected version:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
    <dialogues>
        <dialogue>
            <order>dialogue order</order>
            <speaker>speaker name</speaker>
            <text>dialogue or narration</text>
        </dialogue>
    </dialogues>
</game>
```

I've added the missing `encoding` attribute to the XML declaration, closed the `<dialogue>` tag properly, and removed the unnecessary closing `/<dialogues>` since it was not needed.
