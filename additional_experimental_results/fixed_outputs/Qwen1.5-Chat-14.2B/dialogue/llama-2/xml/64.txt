Here is the corrected XML data, with proper syntax and indentation:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>1</order>
			<speaker>Bill</speaker>
			<text>I like to go to the movies.</text>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue>
			<order>2</order>
			<speaker>Susan</speaker>
			<text>I like to go to the movies.</text>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue>
			<order>3</order>
			<speaker>Joe</speaker>
			<text>I like to go to the movies.</text>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```

I have added `encoding="UTF-8"` attribute to the XML declaration, fixed the closing `</dialogue>` tags, and properly indented the elements. Now it is a valid XML document.
