The provided XML data has a syntax error where the closing `</dialogue>` tag is missing and there's an extra angle bracket after `</text>`. Here is the corrected XML:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>dialogue order</order>
			<speaker>speaker name</speaker>
			<text>dialogue or narration</text>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```

The `</dialogue>` tag has been added after the `<text>` element, and the extra angle bracket is removed.
