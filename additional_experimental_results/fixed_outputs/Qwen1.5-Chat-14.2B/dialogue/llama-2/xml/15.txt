```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
    <dialogues>
        <dialogue>
            <order>1</order>
            <speaker>Alice</speaker>
            <text>Hello, Bob. How are you?</text>
        </dialogue>
        <dialogue>
            <order>2</order>
            <speaker>Bob</speaker>
            <text>I'm fine, Alice. How are you?</text>
        </dialogue>
    </dialogues>
</game>
```
The XML has been corrected by adding a missing `encoding` attribute to the root element and closing the tags correctly (`<dialogue>` and `</dialogue>`, `<dialogues>` and `</dialogues>`). I've also removed the extra line breaks in the example data.
