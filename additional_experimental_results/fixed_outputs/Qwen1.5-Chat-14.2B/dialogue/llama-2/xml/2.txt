The original XML data provided seems to be well-formed and does not contain any syntax errors mentioned in the error message you provided. Therefore, there is no need for correction. Here's the unchanged XML:

```xml
<dialogue>
	<order>1</order>
	<speaker>John</speaker>
	<text>Hello, my name is John. I am a very nice person. I am a good friend. I am a very good person.</text>
</dialogue>
```

If you want to add more dialogues with the same structure, just follow this pattern and replace the values as needed. For example:

```xml
<dialogue>
	<order>2</order>
	<speaker>Jane</speaker>
	<text>Hello, my name is Jane. I am a very nice person too.</text>
</dialogue>

<!-- Add more dialogue elements as needed -->
```

Please provide the specific dialogues you'd like to include, or indicate if you want to create a list of 36 or more dialogues with speaker "Joe".
