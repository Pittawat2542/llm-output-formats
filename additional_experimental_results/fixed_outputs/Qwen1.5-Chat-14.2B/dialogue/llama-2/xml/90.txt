```xml
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>dialogue order</order>
			<speaker>speaker name</speaker>
			<text>dialogue or narration</text>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```
The original XML data had a syntax error where the closing `</dialogue>` tag was missing after `<text>`. I have fixed this by adding the closing tag properly.
