Here is the corrected XML data:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>dialogue order</order>
			<speaker>speaker name</speaker>
			<text>dialogue or narration</text>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```

The original XML had a missing `encoding` attribute in the XML declaration, and the closing tags for `<dialogue>` and `<dialogues>` were not properly formed. I have fixed these issues to ensure that the XML is well-formed and valid.
