Here's the fixed XML data:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
    <dialogues>
        <dialogue>
            <order>dialogue order</order>
            <speaker>speaker name</speaker>
            <text>dialogue or narration</text>
        </dialogue>
    </dialogues>
</game>
```

I've made the following changes:

1. Added an attribute `encoding="UTF-8"` to the top XML declaration for consistency.
2. Closed the `<dialogue>` tag properly with `</dialogue>`.
3. Removed the extra space inside the last line before `</dialogues>`.

Now the XML is well-formed and valid.
