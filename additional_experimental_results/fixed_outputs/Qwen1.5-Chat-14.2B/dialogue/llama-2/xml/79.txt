```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>dialogue order</order>
			<speaker>speaker name</speaker>
			<text>dialogue or narration</text>
		</dialogue>
		<!-- Add another dialogue if needed -->
	</dialogues>
</game>
```

The issue was with the missing closing `</dialogue>` tag in the original XML. I have fixed it by adding the closing tag for each `<dialogue>`. If you need to add more dialogues, copy the `<dialogue>` structure and paste it below the existing one, updating the `order` and `speaker` attributes as needed.
