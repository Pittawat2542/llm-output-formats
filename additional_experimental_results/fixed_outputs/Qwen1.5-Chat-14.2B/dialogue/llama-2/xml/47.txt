The XML data provided had some incorrect syntax, specifically in the closing `</dialogue>` tag and the last `</dialogues>` tag. Here's the corrected XML:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>1</order>
			<speaker>Alice</speaker>
			<text>Alice: I'm going to the store. Do you want anything?</text>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue>
			<order>2</order>
			<speaker>Bob</speaker>
			<text>Bob: Sure. I want a pizza.</text>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```

Note that the `encoding` attribute is added to the XML declaration for better compatibility and the closing tags were fixed. Now, the XML structure is correct according to the provided template.
