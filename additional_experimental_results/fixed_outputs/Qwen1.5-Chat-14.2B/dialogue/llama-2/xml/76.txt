The XML data provided was already correct, with only a missing closing `</dialogue>` tag. Here's the corrected version:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
			<dialogue>
				<order>dialogue order</order>
				<speaker>speaker name</speaker>
				<text>dialogue or narration</text>
			</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```

The example provided in the question is now fixed.
