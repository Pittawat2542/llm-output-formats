The XML data was missing a closing `>` for the `<dialogue>` element on line 10. Here's the corrected XML:

```xml
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>dialogue order</order>
			<speaker>speaker name</speaker>
			<text>dialogue or narration</text>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```

Now the XML syntax is correct, and no new values were provided. If you need to provide specific values for `<order>` or `<speaker>`, replace them accordingly.
