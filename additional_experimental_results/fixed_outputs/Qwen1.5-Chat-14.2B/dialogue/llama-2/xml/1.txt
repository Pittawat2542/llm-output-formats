Here's the corrected XML data with proper closing tags and indentation:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>dialogue order</order>
			<speaker>speaker name</speaker>
			<text>dialogue or narration</text>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```

The original XML had a missing closing `</dialogue>` tag, and the indentation was improved for clarity.
