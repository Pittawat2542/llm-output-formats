Here's the corrected XML data:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
    <dialogues>
        <dialogue>
            <order>dialogue order</order>
            <speaker>speaker name</speaker>
            <text>dialogue or narration</text>
        </dialogue>
    </dialogues>
</game>
```

The issue was that the closing `</dialogue>` tag was missing a `/` and there was an extra space after `<text>`. Additionally, I added the `"UTF-8"` attribute to the XML declaration for clarity.
