Here is the corrected XML data:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>dialogue order</order>
			<speaker>speaker name</speaker>
			<text>dialogue or narration</text>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```

I made the following changes:
1. Added an "encoding" attribute to the XML declaration with a default value of "UTF-8".
2. Closed the `<dialogue>` tag properly, which was missing in the original data.
3. Removed the unnecessary opening `<dialogue>` tag before the closing `</dialogue>` tag inside the `<dialogues>` parent element.
