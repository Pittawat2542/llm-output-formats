The YAML data was not incorrect; it had a minor formatting issue where the indentation of the `text` key in some dialogue items was missing. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: 1
      speaker: John
      text: "Hello, what can I do for you?"
    - order: 2
      speaker: Jane
      text: "I need help with my homework."
    - order: 3
      speaker: John
      text: "Okay, I'll help you."
    - order: 4
      speaker: Jane
      text: "Thank you, John."
    - order: 5
      speaker: John
      text: "You're welcome."
```

The indentation with four spaces after the dash (`-`) was missing in the original data. Now it is correctly formatted and can be used as needed.
