      speaker: A
      text: "A: Hello, B!"
      - order: 2
        speaker: B
        text: "B: Hello, A!"
      - order: 3
        speaker: A
        text: "A: What are you doing here?"
      - order: 4
        speaker: B
        text: "B: I came to see you."
      - order: 5
        speaker: A
        text: "A: Why?"
      - order: 6
        speaker: B
        text: "B: I just wanted to say hi."
      - order: 7
        speaker: A
        text: "A: I see."
      - order: 8
        speaker: B
        text: "B: I have to go now."
      - order: 9
        speaker: A
        text: "A: Okay."

    # Add the remaining dialogues and narration as separate entries
    - order: 10
      narration: "Narration for a dialogue (optional)"
      - order: 11
        speaker: A
        text: "A's dialogue in narration"
      - order: 12
        speaker: B
        text: "B's dialogue in narration"

    # Repeat this pattern for dialogues and narrations as needed
```
The YAML data has been corrected to use a nested list structure for the `text` entries, which allows multiple lines of dialogue within each entry. The `narration` keys are added separately with their own text under the appropriate dialogue order if needed.
