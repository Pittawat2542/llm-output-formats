All examples provided are correct YAML data, with no syntax errors. Here's the same YAML data in a code block:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text: dialogue or narration
```

If you want to provide new values for the `dialogues` list, replace the placeholders with your desired content.
