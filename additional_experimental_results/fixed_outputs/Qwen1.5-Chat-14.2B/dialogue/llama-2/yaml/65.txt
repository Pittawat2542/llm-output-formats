The original YAML data provided is already correct. There were no syntax issues mentioned in the error message, and the given template is valid. Here's the fixed YAML code block:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
```
The `-` before each key-value pair indicates that it's an item in a list, which is how `dialogues` should be structured.
