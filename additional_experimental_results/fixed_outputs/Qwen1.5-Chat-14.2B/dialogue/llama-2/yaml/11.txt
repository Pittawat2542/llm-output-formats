The YAML data appears to be correct, there were no syntax errors as mentioned. Here's the corrected YAML code block:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: "dialogue order"
    speaker: "speaker name"
    text: "dialogue or narration"
```

If you want multiple examples with different speakers, add more dialogue entries to the `dialogues` list:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: "dialogue 1"
     speaker: "Speaker A"
     text: "Dialogue for Speaker A"
   - order: "dialogue 2"
     speaker: "Speaker B"
     text: "Dialogue for Speaker B"
   - order: "dialogue order"
     speaker: "speaker name"
     text: "dialogue or narration"
```
