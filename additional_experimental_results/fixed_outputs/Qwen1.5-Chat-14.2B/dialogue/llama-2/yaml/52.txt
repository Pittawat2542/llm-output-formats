The issue with the provided YAML data is that it's missing indentation after the first two lines under `dialogues`. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
```

Now, the YAML is correctly formatted and indented. If you want to add more dialogues, just follow the same structure with additional lines under `dialogues`.
