```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: 1
    speaker: John
    text: "Hello, how are you?"
  - order: 2
    speaker: Mary
    text: "I'm fine, how are you?"
  - order: 3
    speaker: John
    text: "I'm fine, too."
```
The issue was that the `order` values were not correctly indented under the `dialogues` list. I fixed this by adjusting the indentation for each item in the list.
