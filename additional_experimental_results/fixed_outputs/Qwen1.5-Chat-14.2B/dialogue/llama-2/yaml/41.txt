The issue with the original YAML data is that there's a stray `</INST>` at the end, which is not part of the YAML syntax. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text: dialogue or narration
```
The `</INST>` has been removed, and the rest of the data is valid.
