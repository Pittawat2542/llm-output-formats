The provided YAML data has no syntax errors, as the issue mentioned was about incorrect indentation or a stray `'` character, which is not present in this case. Here's the correct YAML representation:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: 1
      speaker: John
      text: "I am John. I'm a nice guy."
    - order: 2
      speaker: John
      text: "I am John. I'm a nice guy."
    - order: 3
      speaker: John
      text: "I am John. I'm a nice guy."
    - order: 4
      speaker: John
      text: "I am John. I'm a nice guy."
    - order: 5
      speaker: John
      text: "I am John. I'm a nice guy."
    - order: 6
      speaker: John
      text: "I am John. I'm a nice guy."
    - order: 7
      speaker: John
      text: "I am John. I'm a nice guy."
    - order: 8
      speaker: John
      text: "I am John. I'm a nice guy."
    - order: 9
      speaker: John
      text: "I am John. I'm a nice guy."
    - order: 10
      speaker: John
      text: "I am John. I'm a nice guy."
```

If you need to add more dialogues, simply replicate the `-` line and adjust the `order` value accordingly.
