The issue with the original YAML data was a missing colon after `order` in the dialogue objects. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: 1
     speaker: Player 1
     text: "Hello, how are you?"
   - order: 2
     speaker: Player 2
     text: "I'm fine, how are you?"
```
The code block containing the fixed YAML is:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: 1
     speaker: Player 1
     text: "Hello, how are you?"
   - order: 2
     speaker: Player 2
     text: "I'm fine, how are you?"
```
