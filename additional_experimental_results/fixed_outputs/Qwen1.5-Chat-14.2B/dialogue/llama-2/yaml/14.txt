Here is the corrected YAML data:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: 1
    speaker: 1
    text: 1
  - order: 2
    speaker: 2
    text: 2
  - order: 3
    speaker: 3
    text: 3
  - order: 4
    speaker: 4
    text: 4
```

The issue was that the `-` character before `order`, `speaker`, and `text` keys in each dialogue item was missing, which is required for a list (`-` signifies an item). Additionally, there should not be any separate YAML documents outside the main structure. The corrected YAML above has all the elements nested under the `game` object within a single document.
