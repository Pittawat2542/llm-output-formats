All the provided examples seem to have correct syntax, and there's no issue with them. The YAML structure is valid for storing a list of dialogues in a game. Here's the corrected code block with the same content:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
```

If you intended to provide multiple examples with different values, please specify which ones should have unique data.
