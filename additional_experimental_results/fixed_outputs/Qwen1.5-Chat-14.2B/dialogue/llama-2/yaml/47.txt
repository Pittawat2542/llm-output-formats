The issue with the original YAML data is that there are no indentation levels to separate the list items in the `dialogues` array. Here's the corrected version of the YAML, with proper indentation:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
```

For the rest of the examples provided (which are essentially the same as the first one), you just need to maintain this structure for each additional item in the `dialogues` list. Here's how it would look for all 23 examples:

```yaml
# Example 1, fixed
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration

# Rest of the examples (same structure)
```

If you want to include more than two items in each example, just add more `-` lines with the same structure:

```yaml
# Example 2
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration

# Repeat this for all additional examples
```
