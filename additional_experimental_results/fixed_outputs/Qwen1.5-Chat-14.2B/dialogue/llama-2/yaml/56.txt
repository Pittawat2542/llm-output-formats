The provided YAML data is already correct and doesn't contain any syntax errors. The `Incorrect_syntax` error message suggests that there's a misunderstanding, likely because of the inline code block formatting in your question. Here's the corrected YAML in a code block:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
```

If you intended to provide new values for the `dialogue` entries, please provide them, and I'll update accordingly.
