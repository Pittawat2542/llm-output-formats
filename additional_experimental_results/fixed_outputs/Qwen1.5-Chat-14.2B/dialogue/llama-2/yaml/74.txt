All the provided examples are identical and there seems to be no syntax error in the YAML data. Here is the correct YAML format with the given template:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
```

If you have different values for `order`, `speaker`, or `text`, replace them accordingly in the template.
