The provided YAML data is correct and does not need any changes. Here it is in a code block:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text: dialogue or narration
```

If you intended to include the `/INST` line as part of the YAML, you would need to escape the backticks since they are not valid within standard YAML syntax. However, without context, I'll assume it's a formatting issue and leave it out. If you do need them for some specific reason, please provide more information.
