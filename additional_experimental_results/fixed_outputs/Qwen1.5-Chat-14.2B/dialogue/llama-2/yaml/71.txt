All the examples provided are correct YAML syntax, assuming they represent a list of game dialogues with an "order," "speaker," and "text" key-value pairs. Here's the code block with the YAML data:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
```

If you intended to provide a different value for any of these keys, please replace the placeholders accordingly.
