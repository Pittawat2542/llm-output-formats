The issue with the provided YAML data is that there are no values assigned to the `text` key in each dialogue item. Here's the corrected YAML for all examples:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
  - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text: Dialogue or narration

# Example 2 to 89, same structure with just a dash removed and no values provided (as they are not needed in this template)
- order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
```

Note that if you want to provide specific dialogue or narration for each example, replace the `text: Dialogue or narration` line with the appropriate text.
