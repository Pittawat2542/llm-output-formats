There's no syntax error in the provided YAML data. Each example is a valid representation of a list within the `game` object with a structure for dialogues. Here's the corrected YAML format, without any changes since there was nothing wrong:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
```

If you want to repeat this example multiple times, you can do it like this (for Example 2 to Example 80), but note that having so many identical blocks may not be practical in a real-world scenario:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
    ...
    (repeat for Example 2 to Example 80)
```
