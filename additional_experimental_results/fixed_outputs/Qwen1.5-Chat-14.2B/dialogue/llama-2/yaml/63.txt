The provided YAML data is correct and doesn't have any syntax errors. Here it is in a code block:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
```

If you meant to add more dialogues, simply copy the structure and append it. For example:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
    - order: another dialogue order
      speaker: another speaker name
      text: another dialogue or narration
    - order: third dialogue order
      speaker: yet another speaker name
      text: third dialogue or narration
```
