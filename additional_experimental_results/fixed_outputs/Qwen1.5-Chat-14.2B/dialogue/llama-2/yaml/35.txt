    # Additional dialogues if needed, follow this pattern:

      speaker: Bob
      text: "I still need assistance."
    - order: 8
      speaker: Alice
      text: "Of course, what do you need help with?"
    - order: 9
      speaker: Bob
      text: "Please guide me through the process."

  # If there are more dialogues with multiple speakers, continue the list in this format.
