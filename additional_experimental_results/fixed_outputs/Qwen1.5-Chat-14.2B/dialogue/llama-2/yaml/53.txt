The issue with the original YAML was a stray `</INST>` tag that was not part of the syntax. Removing that, the corrected YAML would be:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text: dialogue or narration
```
And here it is in a code block:
```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: dialogue order
    speaker: speaker name
    text: dialogue or narration
```
