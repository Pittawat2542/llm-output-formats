The issue with the provided YAML data is that there are no values assigned to any keys. To fix this, I'll provide default values for the `order` and `text` fields:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: 1
      speaker: "Player"
      text: "Welcome to the game!"
    - order: 2
      speaker: "NPC"
      text: "Hello, have you completed any quests yet?"
    # Add more dialogue objects as needed...
```

If you want to include a large number of examples without default values, you can simply add them in the same format:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
    - order: another dialogue order
      speaker: other speaker
      text: "Another line of dialogue"
    # ...
```

However, since you've asked for only the YAML in a code block without any specific changes to the examples provided, here it is:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: dialogue order
     speaker: speaker name
     text: dialogue or narration
```
