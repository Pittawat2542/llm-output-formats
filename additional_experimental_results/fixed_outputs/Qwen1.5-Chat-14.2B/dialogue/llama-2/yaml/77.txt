The YAML data provided is correct and does not contain any syntax errors. The examples you've given are all identical, so I'll provide the fixed version only once:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: dialogue order
      speaker: speaker name
      text: dialogue or narration
```

If you intended to show different values for each example, please provide the new values and I can update them accordingly.
