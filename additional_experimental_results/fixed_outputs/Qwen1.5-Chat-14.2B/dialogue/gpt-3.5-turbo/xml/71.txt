Here is the corrected XML data:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
    <dialogues>
        <dialogue>
            <order>1</order>
            <speaker>Player</speaker>
            <text>Hey, how are you doing?</text>
        </dialogue>
        <dialogue>
            <order>2</order>
            <speaker>NPC</speaker>
            <text>I'm good, thanks for asking. How about you?</text>
        </dialogue>
        <dialogue>
            <order>3</order>
            <speaker>Player</speaker>
            <text>I'm doing great too.</text>
        </dialogue>
        <dialogue>
            <order>4</order>
            <speaker>NPC</speaker>
            <text>That's wonderful to hear!</text>
        </dialogue>
    </dialogues>
</game>
```

I added the missing closing `</dialogue>` tags and set the encoding attribute to "UTF-8" for compatibility. The rest of the structure was correct, just needed these adjustments.
