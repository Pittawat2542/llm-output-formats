Here's the corrected XML data:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>1</order>
			<speaker>Player</speaker>
			<text>Hey, how are you?</text>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue>
			<order>2</order>
			<speaker>NPC</speaker>
			<text>I'm good, thanks for asking. And you?</text>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue>
			<order>3</order>
			<speaker>Player</speaker>
			<text>I'm doing great too, thanks!</text>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```

The changes made include:

1. Adding the `encoding` attribute to the XML declaration with a default value of "UTF-8".
2. Closing the `<dialogue>` tags properly with `/` before moving on to the next dialogue.
3. Adjusting indentation for better readability, though this is not required for correct syntax.
