The original XML data had a missing closing `</dialogue>` tag in the third dialogue. Here's the corrected XML:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>1</order>
			<speaker>Player</speaker>
			<text>Hello, how are you?</text>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue>
			<order>2</order>
			<speaker>NPC</speaker>
			<text>I'm fine, thank you. How about you?</text>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue>
			<order>3</order>
			<speaker>Player</speaker>
			<text>I'm doing great too, thanks for asking!</text>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```
