The XML data provided was not well-formed due to a missing closing `</dialogue>` tag for the first dialogue and an extra opening `<dialogue>` tag after the fourth dialogue. Here's the corrected XML:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>1</order>
			<speaker>Player</speaker>
			<text>Hello, is anyone there?</text>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue>
			<order>2</order>
			<speaker>NPC</speaker>
			<text>Yes, I'm here. How can I help you?</text>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue>
			<order>3</order>
			<speaker>Player</speaker>
			<text>I need some information about the quest.</text>
		</dialogue>
		<dialogue>
			<order>4</order>
			<speaker>NPC</speaker>
			<text>Sure, what do you want to know?</text>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
