Here's the corrected XML data with proper syntax and indentation:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
    <dialogues>
        <dialogue>
            <order>1</order>
            <speaker>Player</speaker>
            <text>Hello, how are you?</text>
        </dialogue>
        <dialogue>
            <order>2</order>
            <speaker>Non-player Character</speaker>
            <text>I'm good, thank you. How about you?</text>
        </dialogue>
        <dialogue>
            <order>3</order>
            <speaker>Player</speaker>
            <text>I'm great. What are you up to today?</text>
        </dialogue>
        <dialogue>
            <order>4</order>
            <speaker>Non-player Character</speaker>
            <text>I'm just working on some tasks for the game.</text>
        </dialogue>
    </dialogues>
</game>
```

The changes made are:
1. Added `encoding="UTF-8"` attribute to the XML declaration.
2. Closed the `<dialogue>` tags properly.
3. Indented the elements for better readability.
