The YAML syntax in the original message is correct, but there's a small formatting issue where single quotes around dialogue are not escaped properly for compatibility with YAML. Here's the corrected version:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: 1
      speaker: Sarah
      text: 'Hello, is everyone ready to begin the adventure?'
    - order: 2
      speaker: John
      text: 'I\'ve been preparing for weeks. I know these woods like the back of my hand.'
    - order: 3
      speaker: Sarah
      text: 'Great. Then let's get moving. We have a long journey ahead of us.'
    - order: 4
      speaker: John
      text: 'Wait, what's that noise? Do you hear that?'
    - order: 5
      speaker: Sarah
      text: 'It sounds like an animal. But we should still be careful. Stay close.'
```
The code block with the fixed YAML is as follows:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
    - order: 1
      speaker: Sarah
      text: 'Hello, is everyone ready to begin the adventure?'
    - order: 2
      speaker: John
      text: 'I\'ve been preparing for weeks. I know these woods like the back of my hand.'
    - order: 3
      speaker: Sarah
      text: 'Great. Then let's get moving. We have a long journey ahead of us.'
    - order: 4
      speaker: John
      text: 'Wait, what\'s that noise? Do you hear that?'
    - order: 5
      speaker: Sarah
      text: 'It sounds like an animal. But we should still be careful. Stay close.'
