The issue in the original YAML data is that there's an extra colon after the `speaker` key in the second dialogue. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  dialogues:
   - order: 1
     speaker: player
     text: "Hey there, how are you?"
   - order: 2
     speaker: NPC
     text: "I'm very well, it's a pleasure to meet you."
```

The YAML is now in correct syntax.
