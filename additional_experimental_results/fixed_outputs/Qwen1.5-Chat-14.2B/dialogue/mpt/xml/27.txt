```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<dialogues>
		<dialogue>
			<order>dialogue order</order>
			<speaker>speaker name</speaker>
			<text>dialogue or narration</text>
		</dialogue>
	</dialogues>
</game>
```
The original XML data had a syntax error with the missing closing `</dialogue>` tag and an extra angle bracket in the opening line. I've fixed those issues, added the required encoding attribute to the XML declaration, and properly closed the `<dialogue>` and `<dialogues>` tags.
