The issue is that the root of the YAML structure should be a dictionary, but there's no key-value pair at the beginning. Let's fix it by adding an empty dictionary as the root.

Corrected YAML:
```yaml
game:
  description: quest description
  id: id
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
    - description: task description
      location: task location
      objective: task objective
      order: task order
  title: quest title
```
```
