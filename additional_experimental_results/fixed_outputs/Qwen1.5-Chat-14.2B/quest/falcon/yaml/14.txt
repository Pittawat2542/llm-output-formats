```yaml
game:
  - name: name
  description: quest description
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
    - id: task_id
      description: task description
      location: task location
      objective: task objective
```
The original YAML had a syntax error where it tried to nest a mapping (`- name: ...`) under another list item (`tasks`). To fix this, I removed the indentation of `description` and made `name` a separate top-level key under `game`. Now the structure is correct.
