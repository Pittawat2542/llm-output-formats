The original YAML data seems to have a formatting issue, causing the error. Here's the corrected version:

```yaml
id: id
---
game:
  description: quest description
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
    - description: task description
      location: task location
      objective: task objective
      order: task order
  title: quest title
```

The changes I made include:

1. Removing the unnecessary `YAML` strings in the values.
2. Placing the `---` indicator after the `id:` key to separate the document from the following game object.
3. Proper indentation for a YAML list (`tasks:`) and its items.

Now, this should be a valid single-document YAML structure.
