The issue with the provided YAML data is that it has an extra indentation for the `objective` key under the `game` object. To fix this, we need to remove the unnecessary indentation and make sure all levels are properly aligned. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  description: quest title
  id: {{id}}
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward

tasks:
  - description: task description
    location: task location
    objective: task objective
    order: task order

title: Example Quest
```

The YAML now has the correct syntax, and it includes a `title` key at the end.
