```yaml
game:
  description: "Quest description"
  id: quest_id
  objective: "Quest objective"
  quest_giver: quest_giver_name
  reward: quest_reward
  title: "My Quest"

  # Tasks should be under the 'tasks' key
  tasks:
    - name: Task 1
      description: "Task description
        \n* * *
        This task may take some time. (e.g., 2 hours)"
      location: task_location
      objective: "Task objective"
      order: 1

    # Add additional tasks as needed, keeping the structure consistent
    - name: Task 2
      description: "Another task description here"
      location: another_task_location
      objective: "Objective for task 2"
      order: 2
```
The fixed YAML structure removes the incorrect syntax on line 5 and organizes tasks under the 'tasks' key. I've also added more appropriate key-value pairs, such as 'quest_giver_name' and 'quest_id', and removed some unnecessary formatting from the description.
