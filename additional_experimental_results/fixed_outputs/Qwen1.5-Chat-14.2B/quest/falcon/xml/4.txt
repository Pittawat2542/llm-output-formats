In this fixed XML, I added a missing `<reward>` element with a `type` attribute set to "experience" and provided a default value for the reward. Additionally, I included the missing `<quest-giver>` key with a value of "Guidekeeper". Lastly, I added the `<tasks>` element with two child `<task>` elements, each having unique IDs and filling in the necessary attributes.
