```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<title>quests</title>
	<description>This is a list of quests.</description>
	<tasks>
		<task>
			<name id="0">objective</name>
			<description description="- ?@id:=0"></description>
			<objective>task objective</objective>
			<order>task order</order>
		</task>
		<!-- Additional tasks can be added following the same structure -->
	</tasks>
	<quest-giver></quest-giver>
	<!-- Include quest details here, if needed -->
</game>
```

In this corrected XML format, I've removed the incorrect syntax at the beginning and added a `<description>` element with the given `Markdown` code block. I also changed the structure to reflect that the quests are part of the `game` root element. The `quest-giver` is left empty because no specific value was provided in the original message, but it can be filled in as needed.
