The original XML provided is not actually incorrect, it seems to be a mix of Markdown and XML. The Markdown syntax needs to be removed to get the correct XML structure. Here's the fixed version:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<id>id</id>
	<title>quest title</title>
	<objective>quest objective</objective>
	<description>quest description</description>
	<reward>quest reward</reward>
	<quest-giver>quest giver</quest-giver>
	<tasks>
		<task>
			<order>task order</order>
			<objective>task objective</objective>
			<description>task description</description>
			<location>task location</location>
		</task>
	</tasks>
</game>
```

The changes made are:
1. Removed the `<!DOCTYPE markdown>` declaration, as it's not part of XML.
2. Encoded the XML with `<xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8">` to specify character encoding (which is optional but good practice).
3. Closed the `<tasks>` and `<task>` tags properly without the extra `</task>` inside the `<tasks>` tag.
