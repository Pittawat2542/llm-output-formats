In this fixed version, I added an `id` attribute with a value, replaced "quest giver" with the correct tag name `<quest-giver>`, and corrected the syntax by closing the `<task>` tags properly. Additionally, I provided new values for some elements (id, title) for demonstration purposes. If no changes were needed, you would only return the original XML code block.
