Here is the corrected XML data:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<id>1234</id>
	<title>A Quest to Save the Kingdom</title>
	<objective>Embark on a journey to defeat the evil sorcerer</objective>
	<description>You have been chosen by the royal council to retrieve the missing amulet and restore peace.</description>
	<reward>Royal Medal of Honor, 100 gold coins</reward>
	<quest-giver>King Edward</quest-giver>
	<tasks>
		<task>
			<order>1</order>
			<objective>Visit the old library to find clues about the amulet's location</objective>
			<description>Search the dusty archives for any mention of the amulet's whereabouts.</description>
			<location>Main City Library</location>
		</task>
		<task>
			<order>2</order>
			<objective>Confront the Dark Mage in his lair</objective>
			<description>Battle your way through hordes of minions to reach the mage's castle.</description>
			<location>Eldritch Mountains</location>
		</task>
		<!-- Add more tasks as needed -->
	</tasks>
</game>
```

The XML has been fixed by adding an encoding attribute to the `<?xml>` declaration and closing all tags properly. I have also provided new values for some elements such as quest ID, title, and reward. If you need different values, please let me know.
