Here's the corrected XML data with proper syntax and values for missing elements:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<id>12345</id>
	<title>A Quest to Save the Kingdom</title>
	<objective>Conquer the Dark Tower and defeat the evil sorcerer</objective>
	<description>You have been chosen by the king to embark on a journey to retrieve the mystical amulet that holds the key to defeating the sorcerer. Along the way, you'll encounter various challenges and allies.</description>
	<reward>Royal Amulet, 100 Gold Pieces, Hero's Medal</reward>
	<quest-giver>King Edward</quest-giver>
	<tasks>
		<task id="1">
			<order>1</order>
			<objective>Visit the village of Willowgrove for clues about the amulet</objective>
			<description>Pick up a map from the village elder's house and gather information about the Dark Tower's location.</description>
			<location>Willowgrove Village</location>
		</task>
		<task id="2">
			<order>2</order>
			<objective>Cross the River of Shadows to reach the ancient forest</objective>
			<description>Ferry across the river using the local guide's service and navigate through the enchanted woods.</description>
			<location>River of Shadows, Ancient Forest</location>
		</task>
	</tasks>
</game>
```

The XML is now well-formed and contains valid syntax. Values have been added for missing elements like `id` and `title`, and a new element `<tasks>` has been closed properly with `</tasks>`.
