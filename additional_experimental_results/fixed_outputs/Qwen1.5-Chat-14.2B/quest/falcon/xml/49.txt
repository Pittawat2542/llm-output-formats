The original XML data had several issues, including incorrect syntax, missing closing tags, and mixing HTML-like elements with XML. Here's the corrected XML format:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
    <id>1</id>
    <title quest-giver="quest giver">quest title</title>
    <objective>quest objective</objective>
    <description>quest description</description>
    <reward>quest reward</reward>
    <quest-giver>quest giver</quest-giver>
    <tasks>
        <task order="1">
            <objective quest-objective="task objective">task 1</objective>
            <description task-description="task 1">task 1 description</description>
            <location>task location</location>
        </task>
        <!-- Other tasks... -->
    </tasks>
</game>
```

Please note that I've removed the HTML-like table elements and replaced them with proper XML structure. If you need to include more tasks, you can add them in a similar `<task>` element under the `<tasks>`.
