Here is the corrected XML data with missing keys added and values for those keys:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<id>1</id>
	<title>Test 1</title>
	<objective>Quest objective</objective>
	<description>Quest description</description>
	<reward>A reward item or currency</reward>
	<quest-giver>The quest giver's name or character</quest-giver>
	<tasks>
			<task>
				<order>Task 1</order>
				<objective>Complete a task objective</objective>
				<description>Description of Task 1</description>
				<location>Task 1 location</location>
			</task>
		<!-- Add more tasks if needed -->
	</tasks>
</game>
```

I have added the `reward`, `quest-giver`, and wrapped the `task` element in `<tasks>` tags as requested. If you need to add more tasks, please provide their details.
