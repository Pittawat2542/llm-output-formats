Here's the corrected XML data:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
    <id>id</id>
    <title>quest title</title>
    <objective>quest objective</objective>
    <description>quest description</description>
    <reward>quest reward</reward>
    <quest-giver>quest giver</quest-giver>
    <tasks>
        <task>
            <order>task order</order>
            <objective task="objective">Task objective</objective>
            <description task="description">Task description</description>
            <location task="location">Task location</location>
        </task>
    </tasks>
</game>
```

I noticed that some tags were not closed properly, such as `<xnn:string>` and `<xmn:list>`. Additionally, I fixed the incorrect closing tag for `quest-giver` and added the necessary attributes to the `<objective>` and `<description>` elements.
