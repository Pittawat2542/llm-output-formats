The XML has been corrected with the following changes:
1. Added an `encoding="UTF-8"` attribute to the XML declaration, which is recommended.
2. Changed "quest title" to "quest_title" (replacing spaces with underscores for readability).
3. Added values for the missing keys: "id_value", "quest_objective", "quest_description", "quest_reward", and "quest_giver_name". If you want specific values, please provide them.
