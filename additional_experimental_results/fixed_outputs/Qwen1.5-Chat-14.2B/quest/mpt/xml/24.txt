The provided XML data has been fixed with proper formatting, closing tags, and attribute values. The `encoding` attribute has also been added to specify the character encoding as UTF-8. If you want to add more tasks, just copy the `<task>` element and paste it below the first one, adjusting the `task_number` accordingly.
