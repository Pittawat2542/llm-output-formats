```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
  <id>id</id>
  <title>quest title</title>
  <objective>quest objective</objective>
  <description>quest description</description>

```
I added the `encoding="UTF-8"` attribute to the XML declaration, which is common but not required. The rest of the structure was already correct, so I left it as is.
