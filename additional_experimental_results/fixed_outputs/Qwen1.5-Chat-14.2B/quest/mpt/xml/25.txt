I corrected the syntax, added a missing closing `>` for `<quest-giver>`, removed unnecessary `/` characters from the URLs, and specified an encoding (`UTF-8`). The values for `id`, `quest giver`, `task location`, etc., were not provided in the original message, so I left them empty. If you want to provide specific values for these keys, please include them accordingly.
