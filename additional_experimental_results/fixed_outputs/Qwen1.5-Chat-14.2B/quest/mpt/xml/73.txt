I have made the following changes:

1. Added `encoding="UTF-8"` to the XML declaration for better compatibility.
2. Properly formatted attribute values by adding a space before and after the equals sign (`=`) for each attribute (e.g., `<id>id_value</id>`).
3. Fixed the closing angle bracket of the `quest-giver` element, replacing it with `/`.
4. Capitalized the quest-related tags as they seem to be descriptive elements.

If you need to provide new values for these elements, please do so and I'll update accordingly.
