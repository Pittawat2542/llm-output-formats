```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<id>id</id>
	<title>quest title</title>
	<objective>quest objective</objective>
	<description>quest description</description>
	<reward>quest reward</reward>
	<quest-giver>quest giver</quest-giver>
	<tasks>
		<task>
			<order>task order</order>
			<objective>task objective</objective>
			<description>task description</description>
			<location>task location</location>
		</task>
	</tasks>
</game>
```
The XML has been fixed by adding a closing `>` for the `quest-giver` element and properly indenting the `task` elements under `<tasks>`. Additionally, I added the attribute `encoding="UTF-8"` to the XML declaration, which is common but not required. Since there was no other syntax error or missing value in the original data provided, I kept the rest of the content intact.
