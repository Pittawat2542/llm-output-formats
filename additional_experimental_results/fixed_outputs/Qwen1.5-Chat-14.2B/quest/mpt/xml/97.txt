I added the missing attribute `encoding="UTF-8"` to the XML declaration. Fixed the syntax by replacing `<quest-giver>` with `<quest_giver>`, and added the `id` attribute to the `id` element with a new value "unique_id" for clarity. Also, I replaced some placeholders like "quest_title" with their respective values and provided an example of how to add nested elements like task under the <tasks> section. If you want to keep them as variables, please replace them accordingly or remove them altogether.
