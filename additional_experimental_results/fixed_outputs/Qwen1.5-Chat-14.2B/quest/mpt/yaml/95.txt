The original YAML data has some indentation issues and an incorrect key name. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  description: quest description
  id: quest id
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
    - description: task description
      location: task location
      objective: task objective
      order: task order
  title: quest title
  game_time: 10 # Fixed indentation for this key
extra_data:
  another_key: another_value # Moved to a separate block, fixed indentation
```

The `game_time` key was added with the wrong indentation and has been moved to be under the `game:` block. The extra data is now in a separate block with proper indentation.
