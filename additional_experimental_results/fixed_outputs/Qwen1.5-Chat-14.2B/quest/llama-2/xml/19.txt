The provided XML data has a missing closing `>` for the `<task>` element in the last task. Here is the corrected XML:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<id>123456789</id>
	<title>The quest of the red dragon</title>
	<objective>You must defeat the red dragon</objective>
	<description>You must defeat the red dragon</description>
	<reward>10000 gold</reward>
	<quest-giver>The king</quest-giver>
	<tasks>
		<task>
			<order>1</order>
			<objective>You must defeat the red dragon</objective>
			<description>You must defeat the red dragon</description>
			<location>The red dragon's cave</location>
		</task>
		<task>
			<order>2</order>
			<objective>You must defeat the red dragon</objective>
			<description>You must defeat the red dragon</description>
			<location>The red dragon's cave</location>
		</task>
	</tasks>
</game>
```

I've added the closing `>` to the last `<task>` element.
