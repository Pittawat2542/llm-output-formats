The XML data provided had incorrect syntax due to a missing closing angle bracket `>` for the `<tasks>` element. I've fixed the issue and added values for the missing `id` attribute. Here's the corrected XML:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game id="1">
	<title>My Quest</title>
	<objective>Complete a task</objective>
	<description>Embark on an adventure to find a treasure.</description>
	<reward>Gold coin</reward>
	<quest-giver>Old Man in the Forest</quest-giver>
	<tasks>
		<task>
			<order>1</order>
			<objective>Climb the Mountain</objective>
			<description>Ascend to the peak and find the hidden path.</description>
			<location>Mountainside</location>
		</task>
	</tasks>
</game>
```

The provided `id` attribute is set to "1", but you can replace it with the desired value if needed.
