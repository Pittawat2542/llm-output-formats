The provided XML data was almost correct, only missing a closing `</task>` tag in the second task. I've fixed that issue and added new values for the tasks if needed. Here's the corrected XML:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<id>1</id>
	<title>The quest of the century</title>
	<objective>Find the treasure</objective>
	<description>The treasure is hidden somewhere in the world. Find it!</description>
	<reward>500000 gold</reward>
	<quest-giver>The king</quest-giver>
	<tasks>
		<task>
			<order>1</order>
			<objective>Find the first clue near the ancient ruins</objective>
			<description>Search for a hidden map in the old castle.</description>
			<location>Ancient Ruins</location>
		</task>
		<task>
			<order>2</order>
			<objective>Follow the map to the treasure cave</objective>
			<description>Trace the coordinates on the map to find the entrance.</description>
