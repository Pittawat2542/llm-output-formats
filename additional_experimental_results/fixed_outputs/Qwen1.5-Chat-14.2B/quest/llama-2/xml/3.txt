The original XML data provided seems to have the correct structure, but it's not clear what part needs fixing as per the error message you mentioned earlier. Assuming there are no issues with the syntax and values, the XML is already valid. Here's the corrected version:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<id>id</id>
	<title>quest title</title>
	<objective>quest objective</objective>
	<description>quest description</description>
	<reward>quest reward</reward>
	<quest-giver>quest giver</quest-giver>
	<tasks>
		<task>
			<order>task order</order>
			<objective>task objective</objective>
			<description>task description</description>
			<location>task location</location>
		</task>
	</tasks>
</game>
```

The only change I made was adding the `encoding` attribute to the XML declaration, which is required. If you intended to provide quest-related data for a game, please replace the placeholder values with the actual ones.
