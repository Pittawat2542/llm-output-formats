Here's the corrected XML data with values from the provided JSON examples:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<id>1234</id>
	<title>The quest title</title>
	<objective>The quest objective</objective>
	<description>The quest description</description>
	<reward>The quest reward</reward>
	<quest-giver>The quest giver</quest-giver>
	<tasks>
		<task>
			<order>1</order>
			<objective>The task objective</objective>
			<description>The task description</description>
			<location>The task location</location>
		</task>
	</tasks>
</game>
```

The first issue was that the XML declaration missing a quote after "UTF-8". I also removed unnecessary indentation and fixed the syntax for `<task>` and closing `</task>`. The provided JSON example for tasks is inside an array, but XML doesn't support arrays directly; instead, tasks are listed as separate elements within the `<tasks>` element.
