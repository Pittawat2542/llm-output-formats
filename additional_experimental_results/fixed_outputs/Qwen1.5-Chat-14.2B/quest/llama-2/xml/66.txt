Here's the fixed XML data with correct syntax and values for a quest example:

```

The original XML had incorrect syntax and misplaced tags. I've made the necessary corrections and added some placeholder values for a quest example. If you want to remove the "Examples" section and just keep the quest data, please let me know.
