Here's the corrected XML data with the questions included:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<questions>
	<!-- Questions -->
	<question>
		<[QUESTION]>
		<id>question id</id>
		<text>question text</text>
		</[QUESTION]>
	</question>
	
	<!-- Repeat the question element for each question -->
	<!-- If there are no questions, remove this section or comment it out -->
</questions>
```

Please note that you need to provide actual values for `question id` and `question text` within the `<[QUESTION]>` and `</[QUESTION]>` tags for each question. The current format assumes a single question, but you can add more questions by repeating the `<question>` element with different ids and texts.
