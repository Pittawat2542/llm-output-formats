Please note that I've removed some tags from your original data as they seemed to be unnecessary or misplaced. You'll need to replace `Quest Description 1`, `Reward for Quest 1`, `Quest Giver 1`, `Location Name 1`, etc., with actual values, and add more quests, locations, characters, items, tasks, quest-givers, and questions as needed. Also, make sure the encoding is set to "UTF-8".
