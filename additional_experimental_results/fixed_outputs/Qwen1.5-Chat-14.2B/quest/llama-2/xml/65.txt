The original message provided is not actually XML but a JSON object wrapped in Markdown. To convert it to valid XML, we need to remove the formatting and adjust the structure accordingly. Here's the corrected XML:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<id id="id">id</id>
	<title questTitle="quest title">quest title</title>
	<objective questObjective="quest objective">quest objective</objective>
	<description questDescription="quest description">quest description</description>
	<reward questReward="quest reward">quest reward</reward>
	<quest-giver questGiver="quest giver">quest giver</quest-giver>
	<tasks>
		<task order="task order">
			<objective taskObjective="task objective">task objective</objective>
			<description taskDescription="task description">task description</description>
			<location taskLocation="task location">task location</location>
		</task>
	</tasks>
</game>
```

I've made the following changes:

1. Removed the Markdown syntax.
2. Encoded the XML with UTF-8 as it's a good practice.
3. Added attributes to elements that had JSON keys.
4. Closed and opened tags properly (`<tasks></task>`).
5. Added closing `</task>` for each task element.
