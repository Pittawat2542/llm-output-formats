Here's the corrected XML data with all the elements and their values included:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<id>quest_id</id>
	<title>The Quest to Save the Kingdom</title>
	<objective>Find the hidden treasure in the Enchanted Forest</objective>
	<description>Your quest begins at the village square, where the wise old wizard tells you about a magical artifact needed to defeat the evil sorcerer.</description>
	<reward>A valuable enchanted sword</reward>
	<quest-giver>The Wise Wizard</quest-giver>
	<tasks>
		<task>
			<order>1</order>
			<objective>Explore the village for clues about the enchanted artifact's location</objective>
			<description>Speak with villagers, search the local marketplace, and examine the village map.</description>
			<location>Village Square</location>
		</task>
		<!-- Add more task elements as needed -->
	</tasks>
</game>
```

I have added attribute `encoding="UTF-8"` to the XML declaration, fixed indentation, and provided default values for some elements. If you need to add more tasks, just copy the `<task>` element and paste it inside the `<tasks>` section, adjusting the `order` value accordingly.
