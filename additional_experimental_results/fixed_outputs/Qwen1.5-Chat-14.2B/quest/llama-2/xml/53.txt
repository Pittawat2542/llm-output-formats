The provided XML data seems to be correct, with no syntax errors. Here's the fixed XML code:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<id>1</id>
	<title>Quest of the Lost King</title>
	<objective>Find the lost king</objective>
	<description>The king has gone missing and you must find him.</description>
	<reward>100 gold</reward>
	<quest-giver>King of the land</quest-giver>
	<tasks>
		<task>
			<order>1</order>
			<objective>Find the king</objective>
			<description>The king has gone missing and you must find him.</description>
			<location>The castle</location>
		</task>
		<task>
			<order>2</order>
			<objective>Find the king</objective>
			<description>The king has gone missing and you must find him.</description>
			<location>The castle</location>
		</task>
	</tasks>
</game>
```
All the examples provided were identical, so I've only included one here as they are all correct.
