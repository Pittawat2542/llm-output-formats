Here is the corrected XML data with all the necessary elements:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<id>12345</id>
	<title>The Wizard's Quest</title>
	<objective>Find the Wizard's magic wand</objective>
	<description>You will need to find the Wizard's magic wand to complete your quest</description>
	<reward>A magic wand</reward>
	<quest-giver>The Wizard</quest-giver>
	<tasks>
		<task order="1">
			<objective>Find the Wizard's magic wand</objective>
			<description>You will need to find the Wizard's magic wand to complete your quest</description>
			<location>The Wizard's house</location>
		</task>
	</tasks>
</game>
```

I've added the missing `encoding` attribute to the XML declaration and properly closed the `<task>` element.
