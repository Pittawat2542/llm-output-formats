The issue with the original YAML data is that there's a stray `^` character at the end of the line. This character shouldn't be there and doesn't affect the syntax, but it can cause issues when parsing. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  description: quest description
  id: id
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
    - description: task description
      location: task location
      objective: task objective
      order: task order
  title: quest title
```

All the provided examples were correct except for Example 1, which had the same issue as mentioned above. The fixed version of Example 1 is the same as the corrected YAML above.
