The original YAML data was correct, except for the indentation of the `tasks` list which should be indented under the `game` key. Here is the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  description: quest description
  id: id
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
    - description: task description
      location: task location
      objective: task objective
      order: task order
  title: quest title
```

If you meant to add more required or optional fields, please provide the necessary details.
