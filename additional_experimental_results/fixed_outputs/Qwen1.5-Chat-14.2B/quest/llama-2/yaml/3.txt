The provided YAML data has a syntax issue where the indentation of the `tasks` list is incorrect. Here's the fixed YAML:

```yaml
game:
  description: "Quest description"
  id: "Quest ID"
  objective: "Quest objective"
  quest_giver: "Quest giver"
  reward: "Quest reward"
  tasks:
    - description: "Task description"
      location: "Task location"
      objective: "Task objective"
      order: "Task order"
    - description: "Another task description"
      location: "Another Task location"
      objective: "Another Task objective"
      order: "Another Task order"
  title: "Quest title"
```

I added the missing indentation for the second task item, and corrected the formatting. Now it's valid YAML syntax.
