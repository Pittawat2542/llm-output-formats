The original YAML data is correct. There were no issues with the syntax. Here's the corrected YAML in a code block:

```yaml
game:
  description: quest description
  id: id
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver:
    description: quest giver description
    id: id
    location: quest giver location
    name: quest giver name
    title: quest giver title
  reward:
    description: quest reward description
    id: id
    location: reward location
    name: reward name
    title: reward title
  tasks:
    - description: task description
      location: task location
      objective: task objective
      order: task order
  title: quest title
```
