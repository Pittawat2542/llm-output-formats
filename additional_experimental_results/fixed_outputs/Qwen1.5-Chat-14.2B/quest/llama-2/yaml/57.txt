The provided YAML data seems to have an unnecessary backtick (`) at the beginning of the document, which is causing the syntax error. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  description: A quest about a quest
  id: 1
  objective: Find the quest giver
  quest_giver: The quest giver
  reward: 5000 gold
  tasks:
    - description: Find the quest giver
      location: The quest giver
      objective: Find the quest giver
      order: 1
    - description: Find the quest giver
      location: The quest giver
      objective: Find the quest giver
      order: 2
  title: A quest about a quest
```
I removed the backtick at the beginning, and everything else looks correct.
