The issue with the original YAML data is that there are consecutive `-` characters at the beginning of some lines, which is incorrect syntax for YAML. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  description: A quest to find a missing cat.
  id: 1
  objective: Find the missing cat.
  quest_giver: The cat owner
  reward: A reward
  tasks:
    - description: Find the missing cat.
      location: The cat owner's house.
      objective: Find the cat.
      order: 1
    - description: Find the missing cat.
      location: The cat owner's house.
      objective: Find the cat.
      order: 2
    - description: Find the missing cat.
      location: The cat owner's house.
      objective: Find the cat.
      order: 3
    - description: Find the missing cat.
      location: The cat owner's house.
      objective: Find the cat.
      order: 4
    - description: Find the missing cat.
      location: The cat owner's house.
      objective: Find the cat.
      order: 5
  title: Find the missing cat.
```

I removed the extra `-` characters from the `tasks` list, and now it's in a valid YAML format.
