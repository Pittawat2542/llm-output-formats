```yaml
- template:
    game:
      description: "Quest description"
      id: "id_value"
      objective: "Quest objective"
      quest_giver: "Quest giver"
      reward: "Quest reward"
      tasks:
        - description: "Task description"
          location: "Task location"
          objective: "Task objective"
          order: "Task order"
      title: "Quest title"
    question: "What is the capital of France?"
    answer: "Paris"
  type: FAQ
```
In this corrected YAML format, I added a dash (-) at the beginning to indicate that this is a list item and removed the incorrect syntax around the question. The `template:` key was also fixed to contain the nested structure properly.
