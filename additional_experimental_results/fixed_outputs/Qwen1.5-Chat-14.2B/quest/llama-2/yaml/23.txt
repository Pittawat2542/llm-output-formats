```yaml
game:
  description: "quest description"
  id: id
  objective: "quest objective"
  quest_giver: "quest giver"
  reward: "quest reward"
  tasks:
    - description: "task description"
      location: "task location"
      objective: "task objective"
      order: "task order"
  title: "quest title"
```
The YAML syntax has been corrected by replacing single backticks with double quotes around the string values, which are not necessary but more conventional in YAML. The corrected code is now between triple backticks to indicate a code block.
