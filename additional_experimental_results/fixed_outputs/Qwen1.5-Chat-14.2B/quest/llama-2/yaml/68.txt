```yaml
game:
  description: "Quest Description"
  id: ID
  objective: "Quest Objective"
  quest_giver: "Quest Giver"
  reward: "Quest Reward"
  tasks:
    - description: "Task Description"
      location: "Task Location"
      objective: "Task Objective"
      order: "Task Order"
  title: "Quest Title"
```
All the issues were related to string quotes. The single backticks (`) were replaced with double quotes (") to fix the YAML syntax.
