The original input was not YAML but a script with some options. The provided "Original" block is not the correct format for a YAML document. To represent the given command line usage as a YAML, we can structure it like this:

```yaml
quest_generator:
  description: Generate quest information in YAML format
  subcommands:
    help:
      description: Show help message
      usage: quest.py [-h]
    start:
      description: Start a new quest with given game and quest IDs
      options:
        - name: game_id
          alias: -g
          type: int
          required: true
          description: Game ID
        - name: quest_id
          alias: -q
          type: int
          required: true
          description: Quest ID
```

This YAML representation captures the usage and options of the `quest.py` script in a structured format. If you intended to provide a quest template, please update with the quest details as requested earlier.
