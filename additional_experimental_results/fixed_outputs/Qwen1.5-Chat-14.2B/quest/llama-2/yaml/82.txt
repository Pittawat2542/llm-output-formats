```yaml
game:
  description: "quest description"
  id: "id"
  objective: "quest objective"
  quest_giver: "quest giver"
  reward: "quest reward"
  tasks:
    - description: "task description"
      location: "task location"
      objective: "task objective"
      order: "task order"
  title: "quest title"
```
The fixed YAML data has single quotes ('') replaced with double quotes (") around the string values, which is required for correct syntax. The rest of the structure remains the same as in the original example.
