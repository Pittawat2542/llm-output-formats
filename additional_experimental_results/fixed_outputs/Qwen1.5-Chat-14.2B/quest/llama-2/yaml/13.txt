The issue with the original YAML data is that it has consecutive lines without indentation for the `tasks` list items. In YAML, lists should be indented to show the hierarchy. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  description: A quest to find the lost city of Atlantis.
  id: 1
  objective: Find the lost city of Atlantis.
  quest_giver: Professor Jones
  reward: 100 gold
  tasks:

      objective: Find the lost city of Atlantis.
      order: 1

      location: The lost city of Atlantis.
      objective: Find the lost city of Atlantis.
      order: 2
    - description: Find the lost city of Atlantis.
      location: The lost city of Atlantis.
      objective: Find the lost city of Atlantis.
