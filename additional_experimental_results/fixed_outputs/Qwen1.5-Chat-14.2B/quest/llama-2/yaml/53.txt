The original YAML data was already correct and did not require any changes. Here is the fixed YAML in a code block:

```yaml
game:
  description: A game description
  id: 1
  objective: To win
  quest_giver: The quest giver
  reward: A reward
  tasks:
    - description: A task description
      location: A task location
      objective: A task objective
      order: A task order
    - description: Another task description
      location: Another task location
      objective: Another task objective
      order: Another task order
```
