```yaml
game:
  description: "This is a description for the quest."
  id: 1
  objective: "To complete this quest, you must find the object."
  quest_giver: "The quest giver."
  reward: "You will get a reward for completing this quest."
  tasks:
    - description: "Find the object."
      location: "The object is in the location."
      objective: "You must find the object."
      order: 1
  title: "Find the Object"
```
In the original YAML data, there was an error with a single backtick (`) character at the end of the file. I've removed it, and everything else appears to be correct. The fixed YAML is now formatted correctly.
