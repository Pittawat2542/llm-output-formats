The issue with the original YAML data is that it contains consecutive spaces and punctuation within the value for `title`. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  description: A new quest.
  id: 1
  objective: Get a new quest.
  quest_giver: A new quest giver.
  reward: A new quest reward.
  tasks:
    - description: Get a new quest.
      location: A new quest location.
      objective: Get a new quest.
      order: 1
  title: "A new quest."
```

I've enclosed the `title` value in double quotes to properly represent it as a string.
