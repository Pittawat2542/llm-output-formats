The YAML data provided was correct, apart from the unnecessary escape character `\` before the single quote in the word "quest\_giver". When removed, the syntax is correct. Here's the fixed YAML:

```yaml
game:
  description: "The quest description"
  id: "1"
  objective: "The objective"
  quest_giver: "The quest giver"
  reward: "The quest reward"
  tasks:
   - description: "The task description"
    location: "The task location"
    objective: "The task objective"
    order: "The task order"
  title: "The quest title"
```
```
