The original YAML data is missing a key-value pair for the `id` in the `game` object. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  description: quest description
  id: quest_id          # Added the value "quest_id" here
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
    - description: task description
      location: task location
      objective: task objective
      order: task order
  title: quest title

quest_giver: quest_giver
reward: quest_reward
```
Now the `id` key has its value, and the rest of the data is correct. The code block for the YAML format should look like this:

```yaml
game:
  description: quest description
  id: quest_id
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
    - description: task description
      location: task location
      objective: task objective
      order: task order
  title: quest title

quest_giver: quest_giver
reward: quest_reward
```
