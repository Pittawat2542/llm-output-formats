The original YAML data provided is correct, there were no issues with the syntax. However, if you want to separate the quest and task information into two different blocks, you can modify it as follows:

```yaml
game:
  description: quest description
  id: id
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
    - description: task description
      location: task location
      objective: task objective
      order: task order

quests:
  - title: quest title
```

Here, the `tasks` information is moved under the `game` object and the `quests` block represents a separate list of quests with only the `title`. If you want to include more details for quests as well, please provide that information.
