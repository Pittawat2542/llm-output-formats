It seems there are no syntax issues in the provided YAML data. The code block is correct and does not require any changes. Here's the fixed YAML:

```yaml

  id: 1
  objective: "Find the lost treasure"
  quest_giver: "The king"
  reward: "A reward"
  tasks:
    - description: "Find the lost treasure"
      location: "The lost treasure"
      objective: "Find the lost treasure"
      order: 1
    - description: "Find the lost treasure"
      location: "The lost treasure"
      objective: "Find the lost treasure"
