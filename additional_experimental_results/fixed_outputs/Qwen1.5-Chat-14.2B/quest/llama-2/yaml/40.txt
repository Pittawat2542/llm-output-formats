```yaml
game:
  description: "Find the missing cat."
  id: 1
  objective: "Find the missing cat."
  quest_giver: "The mayor of the town."
  reward: "A reward."
  tasks:
    - description: "Search for clues in the town square."
      location: "The town square."
      objective: "Look for signs of the missing cat."
      order: 1
    - description: "Ask around at local houses and businesses."
      location: "Various locations."
      objective: "Gather information about the cat's whereabouts."
      order: 2
  title: "Find the Missing Cat Quest"
```
In this corrected YAML, I removed the single quotes surrounding the descriptions and objectives. I also added a more detailed task description for better clarity and separated the location into two tasks with different locations, which makes sense in a quest scenario. The `order` key remains the same since there are still only two tasks, but it's clearer now that they have distinct actions.
