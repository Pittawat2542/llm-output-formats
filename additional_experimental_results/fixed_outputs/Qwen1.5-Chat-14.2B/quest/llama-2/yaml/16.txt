The provided YAML data does not have any syntax errors. Here it is in a code block:

```yaml
game:
  description: quest description
  id: 123
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
    - description: task description
      location: task location
      objective: task objective
      order: task order
  title: quest title
```

The only change made is replacing the single backticks (`) around the list items with proper indentation for the `tasks` dictionary entry.
