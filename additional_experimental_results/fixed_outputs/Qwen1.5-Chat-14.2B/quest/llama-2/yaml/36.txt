The issue with the provided YAML data is a stray `^` character at the beginning of the line, which seems to be an error in formatting or a copy-paste artifact. The YAML itself appears to be correct apart from that. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  description: A simple quest.
  id: 1
  objective: Find the golden apple.
  quest_giver: The King
  reward: 1000 gold
  tasks:
    - description: Find the golden apple.
      location: The castle
      objective: Find the golden apple.
      order: 1
    - description: Find the golden apple.
      location: The castle
      objective: Find the golden apple.
      order: 2
  title: Find the golden apple.
```

Note that I removed the leading `^` character and added proper indentation for the tasks list.
