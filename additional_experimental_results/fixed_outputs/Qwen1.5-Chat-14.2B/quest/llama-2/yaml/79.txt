The issue with the provided YAML data is that there are no indentation levels for the `tasks` list items, which is required in YAML. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  description: quest description
  id: id
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest giver
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
    - description: task description
      location: task location
      objective: task objective
      order: task order
  title: quest title
```
I've added four spaces before each `-` to indicate that these items are nested within the `tasks` key. Now it's valid YAML syntax.
