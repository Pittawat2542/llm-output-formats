The issue with the provided YAML data is that it contains a backtick (`) character, which is not valid within a YAML document. To fix this, remove the backticks around the words like "quest giver" and "quest reward". Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  description: quest description
  id: id
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: quest_giver
  reward: quest_reward
  tasks:
   - description: task description
    location: task location
    objective: task objective
    order: task order
  title: quest title
```

Now the YAML is correct and can be used without any issues.
