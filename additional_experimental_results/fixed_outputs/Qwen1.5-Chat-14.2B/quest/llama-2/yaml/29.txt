The issue with the provided YAML data is that it contains no syntax errors, and all examples are valid. However, if you'd like to have a single YAML block without repeating the same structure, here's an example combining them into one document:

```yaml
game:
  quests:
    - id: id1
      description: quest description
      objective: quest objective
      quest_giver: quest giver
      reward: quest reward
      tasks:
        - description: task description
          location: task location
          objective: task objective
          order: task order
      title: quest 1 title

    - id: id2
      description: another quest description
      objective: another quest objective
      quest_giver: another quest giver
      reward: another quest reward
      tasks:
        - description: other task description
          location: other task location
          objective: other task objective
          order: other task order
      title: quest 2 title

    # Add more quests as needed...
```

This YAML block defines multiple quests under the `quests` key, each with their own unique values. If you only need one example, remove the `-` before the first quest, and it will be a standalone object without the list structure.
