The issue was the incorrect syntax where a backtick (`) was found, which is not valid in YAML. I've removed the shebang line and fixed the indentation for the tasks list. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
---
### Example

game:
  description: The quest description
  id: 123
  objective: The quest objective
  quest_giver: The quest giver
  reward: The quest reward
  tasks:
    - description: The task description
      location: The task location
      objective: The task objective
      order: The task order
    - description: The task description
      location: The task location
      objective: The task objective
      order: The task order
    - description: The task description
      location: The task location
      objective: The task objective
      order: The task order
  title: The quest title
```
The YAML is now fixed and in a proper format.
