The issue with the original YAML data is that there are no indentation levels for `tasks` items. The correct syntax requires indented lines under the `tasks` key. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  description: A Quest
  id: 1
  objective: to find the lost ring
  quest_giver: the king
  reward: a knighthood
  tasks:
    - description: find the lost ring
      location: in the castle
      objective: find the lost ring
      order: 1
    - description: find the lost ring
      location: in the castle
      objective: find the lost ring
      order: 2
    - description: find the lost ring
      location: in the castle
      objective: find the lost ring
      order: 3
    - description: find the lost ring
      location: in the castle
      objective: find the lost ring
      order: 4
  title: A Quest
```
Now, all `tasks` items have proper indentation.
