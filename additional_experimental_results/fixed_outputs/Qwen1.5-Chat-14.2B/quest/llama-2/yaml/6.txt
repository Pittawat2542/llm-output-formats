The original YAML data was correct. Here's the corrected code block:

```yaml
game:
  description: "This is a quest description."
  id: 1
  objective: "This is a quest objective."
  quest_giver: "This is a quest giver."
  reward: "This is a quest reward."
  tasks:
   - description: "This is a task description."
    location: "This is a task location."
    objective: "This is a task objective."
    order: 1
   - description: "Another task description."
    location: "Another task location."
    objective: "Another task objective."
    order: 2
   - description: "Yet another task description."
    location: "Yet another task location."
    objective: "Yet another task objective."
    order: 3
  title: "This is a quest title."
```
