The YAML data provided was not incorrect, but there seems to be an unnecessary markdown block at the end. Here is the corrected YAML code:

```yaml
game:
  description: "quest description"
  id: id
  objective: "quest objective"
  quest_giver: "quest giver"
  reward: "quest reward"
  tasks:
    - description: "task description"
      location: "task location"
      objective: "task objective"
      order: "task order"
  title: "quest title"
```
