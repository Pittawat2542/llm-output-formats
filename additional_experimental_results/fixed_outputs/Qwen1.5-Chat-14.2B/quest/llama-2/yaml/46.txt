The issue with the original YAML data is that there's an extra backtick (`) at the end of the file. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  description: A quest to get a quest reward
  id: 1
  objective: Get quest reward
  quest_giver: Someone
  reward: A quest reward
  tasks:
    - description: Get a quest reward
      location: Somewhere
      objective: Get quest reward
      order: 1
    - description: Get a quest reward
      location: Somewhere
      objective: Get quest reward
      order: 2
    - description: Get a quest reward
      location: Somewhere
      objective: Get quest reward
      order: 3
  title: A quest to get a quest reward
```

Note: If you want to include the `INST` or any other instructions as a comment, you can do so by adding it after the YAML data, but outside the YAML syntax. For example:

```yaml
game:
  # Instructions (e.g., [INST])
  description: A quest to get a quest reward
  id: 1
  objective: Get quest reward
  quest_giver: Someone
  reward: A quest reward
  tasks:
    - description: Get a quest reward
      location: Somewhere
      objective: Get quest reward
      order: 1
    - description: Get a quest reward
      location: Somewhere
      objective: Get quest reward
      order: 2
    - description: Get a quest reward
      location: Somewhere
      objective: Get quest reward
      order: 3
  title: A quest to get a quest reward
```
