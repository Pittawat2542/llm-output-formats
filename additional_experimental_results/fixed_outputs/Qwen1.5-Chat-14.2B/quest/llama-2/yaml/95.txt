The incorrect YAML syntax was due to the use of angle brackets `<` and `>` instead of asterisks `*`. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  description: quest description
  id: <<QUESTID>>
  objective: quest objective
  quest_giver: <<QUESTGIVER>>
  reward: quest reward
  tasks:
    - description: task description
      location: task location
      objective: <<TASKOBJ>>
      order: <<TASKORDER>>
  title: <<QUESTTITLE>>
  
Quest Giver: <<QUESTGIVER>>
Quest Title: <<QUESTTITLE>>
Quest Description: <<QUESTDESC>>
Quest Reward: <<QUESTREW>>
Quest Objective: <<QUESTOBJ>>
Quest Tasks: <<QUESTTASK>>
Quest Task Description: <<TASKDESC>>
Quest Task Location: <<TASKLOC>>
```

Note that I've removed the asterisks from around the quest-related keys and replaced them with angle brackets, as per the original example. The rest of the YAML structure remains the same.
