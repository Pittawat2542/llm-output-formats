  beginning: In the realm of Etheria,
    a peaceful kingdom enchanted with magic and rich in culture,
    is suddenly invaded by dark forces. The player,
    an apprentice mage with latent abilities,
    begins their journey in the palace library, just as the attack begins.
    Their mentor thrusts upon them a mystical artifact,
    forcing a rush of untamed magic into their body.

  ending: 
    The player, now a true archmage,
    makes the final stand in the battle-scarred ruins of the royal palace.

    they manage to overcome the forces of darkness
    and banish the lead villain,
    thus restoring Etheria to its former glory.
    With the realm saved and the adventure ended,
    the apprentice-mage can now focus on rebuilding Etheria.
