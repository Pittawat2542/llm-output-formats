The original YAML data had a syntax error because it was using square brackets (`[ ]`) instead of indentation for the block mapping. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  beginning: I wake up in my bed, feeling drowsy and unsure what I did last night. Someone must have hit me on the head.
  ending: As I come to my senses, I realize the events of the previous night. I have a massive headache and decide to search my memory for clues.
  synopsis:
    A group of friends play a game to remember what happened the previous night. The story takes an unexpected turn when they stumble onto an ancient artifact, which brings them closer in uncovering the truth.
  title: Return of the Ancients
```

The `synopsis` key should be indented under the main `game` block to indicate it is a nested mapping. I also removed the `[ ]` around `game`, as it's not needed for this structure.
