The original YAML data provided had a syntax error due to a stray backtick (`) at the beginning. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  beginning: "the beginning of the game"
  ending: "the ending of the game"
  synopsis: |
    Game story synopsis
  title: "game title"
```

The `|` before the `synopsis` value indicates that the following text should be treated as a literal block, preserving its formatting.
