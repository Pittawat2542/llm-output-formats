The issue with the original YAML data is that there seems to be a syntax error due to a stray `^` character at the beginning. The corrected YAML should look like this:

```yaml
game:
  beginning: "the beginning of the game"
  ending: "the ending of the game"
  synopsis: "game story synopsis"
  title: "Return Game Title"
```
The `"` around the string values are added to indicate that they are strings in YAML. If you want to remove them, here's the version without quotes:

```yaml
game:
  beginning: the beginning of the game
  ending: the ending of the game
  synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: Return Game Title
```
