```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>
		<p>The synopsis of the game.</p>
	</synopsis>
	<beginning>The beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>The ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```
I have added the missing `beginning` and `ending` keys with their respective values. The XML version attribute has been set to "1.0" and I've included an encoding attribute for better compatibility (though not strictly necessary).
