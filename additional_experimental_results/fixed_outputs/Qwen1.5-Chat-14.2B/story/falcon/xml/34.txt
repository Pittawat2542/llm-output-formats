```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>The beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>The ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```
Note: I have corrected the XML syntax by changing `<game-title>` to `<title>`, removed unnecessary closing `</title>` tag, and added values for the missing `synopsis`, `beginning`, and `ending` keys.
