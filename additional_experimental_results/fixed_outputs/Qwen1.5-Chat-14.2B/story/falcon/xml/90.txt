The original message provided seems to be in Markdown format, not XML. To fix it and convert it to a valid XML document with the given template structure, I'll remove the Markdown syntax and add the necessary XML tags. Here's the corrected XML:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<title>Game Title</title>
	<synopsis>Synopsis of the game story</synopsis>
	<beginning>The beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>The ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```

The changes I made are:
1. Added `encoding="UTF-8"` to the XML declaration.
2. Capitalized "game title" and "Game Title" to follow proper XML attribute naming conventions.
3. Changed "game story synopsis" to "Synopsis of the game story" for better clarity.
4. Removed asterisks (*) around the text as they are not needed in XML.
