```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
    <creator role="developer">I am the game's creator and I will take care of any issues you may have!</creator>
    <synopsis>The story synopsis of the game</synopsis>
    <beginning>The beginning of the game has happened!</beginning>
    <ending>The ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```
In this fixed XML, I removed unnecessary tags and attributes, corrected the syntax, and provided new values for `creator` and removed the `data-game-info` attribute since it's not clear what to replace it with. The `xmlns` and `data-xxx` attributes were also simplified or removed as they seemed redundant. If you need specific data in these fields, please provide them.
