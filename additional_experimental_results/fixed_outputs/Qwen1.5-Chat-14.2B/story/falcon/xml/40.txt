Here's the corrected XML code with the values provided in your original message. I've made sure that the syntax is correct and enclosed it in a Markdown code block as requested.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>Title of the Game</title>
	<synopsis>Game Synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>Start of the game</beginning>
	<ending>End of the game</ending>
</game>
```

Please note that if you need to use this XML in a programming context, you should adapt the code examples according to the programming language you are using. The provided code snippets demonstrate how to parse or work with such an XML structure.
