The provided XML data is not well-formed because it uses HTML tags (`<p>`) instead of XML elements. Here's the corrected XML version with the appropriate syntax:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<title>Game Title</title>
	<synopsis>Game Story Synopsis</synopsis>
	<section name="Beginning">
		<text>The beginning of the game</text>
	</section>
	<section name="Ending">
		<text>The ending of the game</text>
	</section>
</game>
```

I have replaced the `<p>` tags with appropriate XML elements (`title`, `synopsis`, and a `section` element) and removed the extraneous Markdown syntax. Now, the XML is well-formed and valid according to XML rules.
