The provided XML data is not well-formed because it contains HTML elements and attributes instead of valid XML. To fix it, I will convert the HTML content into plain text for an XML structure. Here's the corrected XML:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<title>Game Title</title>
	<synopsis>You find yourself on a dark and rainy night. Inside a mysterious mansion, hauntingly beautiful ghosts wander the halls for centuries.</synopsis>
	<beginning>The beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>The ending of the game can be found [here](ending.html)</ending>
</game>
```

Note that I've made the following changes:
1. Encoded the XML with `encoding="UTF-8"`.
2. Changed `<h1>` to `<title>` and removed the HTML tags.
3. Replaced `# Output snippet` with plain text for `<beginning>`.
4. Removed unnecessary `<a>` tag from `<ending>` and replaced it with a textual reference to indicate where the ending is found.
