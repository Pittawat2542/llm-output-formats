```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>The beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>The ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```
The original XML had missing keys `title` and `beginning`, as well as an incorrect closing tag for `<status_text>`. I've corrected these issues in the provided fixed XML. The values for `beginning` are now properly formatted with capitalization, but you can change it to your desired value if needed.
