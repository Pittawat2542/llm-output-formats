```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>

I have fixed the XML syntax by removing the unnecessary HTML-like tags (`#`, `**`). I also added a default encoding attribute to the `xml` declaration. The content within the elements has been adjusted to remove the HTML-style formatting and keep it as plain text.
