The provided XML data is not well-formed due to missing opening and closing tags for elements. Here's the corrected XML:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>the ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```

I've added `encoding="UTF-8"` attribute to the XML declaration and fixed the structure by wrapping all content in `<title>` to `<ending>` elements with their respective closing tags.
