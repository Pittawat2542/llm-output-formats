```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<section>
		<p>The beginning of the game:</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<p>The ending of the game:</p>
	</section>
</game>
```

I've made the following corrections:

1. Added an encoding attribute to the `<?xml>` declaration, which is typically "UTF-8".
2. Changed the opening `<div class="game">` tag to a proper element like `<section>`, assuming this structure should be inside the game element.
3. Wrapped the content under `<beginning>` and `<ending>` in a `<p>` element for clarity, since they seem to represent textual descriptions.
4. Renamed `<beginning>` and `<ending>` tags to `<section>` with appropriate inner text for better readability.
