```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<section name="beginning">
		<p>the beginning of the game</p>
	</section>
	<section name="ending">
		<p>the ending of the game</p>
	</section>
</game>
```
The original XML was missing an attribute for the `<beginning>` and `<ending>` elements, which is required for them to be well-formed. I added `name` attributes with appropriate values and wrapped the text in `<p>` tags as it's common in XML documents to structure content like this.
