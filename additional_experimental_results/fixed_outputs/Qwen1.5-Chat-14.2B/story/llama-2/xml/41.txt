```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<section start="the beginning of the game">
		<description>What happens at the start</description>
	</section>
	<section end="the ending of the game">
		<description>The conclusion of the story</description>
	</section>
</game>
```
The original XML was missing the closing `</game>` tag. I added it along with a `<section>` element to wrap the beginning and ending, assuming they are sections within the game instead of separate elements. If you intended them to remain as separate elements, simply remove the `<section>` tags and adjust the structure accordingly.
