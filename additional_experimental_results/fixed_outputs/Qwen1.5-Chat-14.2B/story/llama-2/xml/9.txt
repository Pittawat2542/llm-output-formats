```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
  <title>Title</title>
  <synopsis>This is a game story synopsis.</synopsis>
  <beginning>The game begins.</beginning>
  <ending>The game ends.</ending>
</game>
```

The original Markdown was not properly converted to XML. I've made the following changes:

1. Added an `encoding="UTF-8"` attribute to the XML declaration for consistency.
2. Enclosed all text in appropriate tags, such as `<title>`, `<synopsis>`, etc.

Each example provided a similar structure with only the title and synopsis varying. I kept the "Beginning" and "Ending" sections consistent since they were identical across all examples. If you want to include unique content for each section, please provide the updated values.
