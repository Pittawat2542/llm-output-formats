The XML data provided has a closing angle bracket (`>``) missing from the `ending` element. Here's the corrected version:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>the ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```

I've added the `encoding="UTF-8"` attribute, which is optional but a good practice. The XML should be well-formed now.
