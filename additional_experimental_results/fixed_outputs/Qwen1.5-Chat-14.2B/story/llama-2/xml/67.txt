The XML data provided is already correct. No changes are needed. Here's the corrected version:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>The game title</title>
	<synopsis>The game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>The beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>The ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```
The XML is well-formed and follows the template you provided. If you need to provide new values, replace `The game title`, `The game story synopsis`, `The beginning of the game`, and `The ending of the game` with your desired content.
