```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<section>
		<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
	</section>
	<section>
		<ending>the ending of the game</ending>
	</section>
</game>
```
The original XML had an incorrect syntax with a missing attribute in the root element. I added `encoding="UTF-8"` for consistency, and wrapped `<beginning>` and `<ending>` under separate `<section>` elements to provide a clear structure.
