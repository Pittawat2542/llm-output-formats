The XML data provided is already correct. Here's the fixed version in a code block:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>the ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```

There were no syntax errors or values that needed to be changed. The XML structure is valid and well-formed.
