```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<section name="beginning">
		<p>The beginning of the game</p>
	</section>
	<section name="ending">
		<p>The ending of the game</p>
	</section>
</game>
```

I've made the following corrections:

1. Added `encoding="UTF-8"` to the XML declaration, which is a common practice.
2. Enclosed the `<beginning>` and `<ending>` content in `<section>` elements with a `name` attribute for clarity and better organization. I named them "beginning" and "ending", respectively. Each section now contains a `<p>` element containing the text.
