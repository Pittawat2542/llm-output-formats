```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
  <title>game title</title>
  <synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
  <beginning>The beginning of the game</beginning>
  <ending>The ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```
Here is the corrected XML data with proper syntax, indentation, and values for `<beginning>` and `<ending>`. The `encoding` attribute has been added to specify UTF-8 encoding.
