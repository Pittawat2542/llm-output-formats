```xml
<game xmlns="http://example.com/game">
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>the ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```
The original XML data was already well-formed, just missing a namespace declaration. I added `xmlns="http://example.com/game"` to indicate the XML schema namespace for clarity even though it's not required in this simple example.
