The XML data provided seems to be correct, as there are no syntax errors indicated. Here's the corrected XML in a code block:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>the ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```

If you meant to add or update values, please provide new ones, and I can adjust accordingly.
