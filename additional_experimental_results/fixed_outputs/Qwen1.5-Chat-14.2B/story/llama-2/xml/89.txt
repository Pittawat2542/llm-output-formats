The original XML data provided is already well-formed and correct. Here's the fixed XML in a code block:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>the ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```

The issue mentioned in the "Error" message is that there was no XML declaration (`<?xml ... ?>`) at the beginning, which has been added in the corrected version.
