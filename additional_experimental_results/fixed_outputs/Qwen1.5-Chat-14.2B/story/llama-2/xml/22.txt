```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
  <title>game title</title>
  <synopsis>This is a game story synopsis.</synopsis>
  <beginning>The game begins with the player being a hero and saving the world from an evil villain.</beginning>
  <ending>The game ends with the player becoming a hero and saving the world from an evil villain.</ending>
</game>
```

I've fixed the incorrect XML syntax by adding the required encoding attribute to the `<?xml version="1.0"?>` declaration, correcting indentation, and removing unnecessary Markdown formatting. The values for `<synopsis>` and each `<ending>` have been wrapped in their respective tags.
