```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<section>
		<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
		<ending>the ending of the game</ending>
	</section>
</game>
```

The original XML was well-formed but missing the required `encoding` attribute in the XML declaration. I added `encoding="UTF-8"` and restructured the content within `<game>` using a `<section>` element to maintain consistency, although it's not clear from the provided information if this was the intended structure. If the original structure is preferred, remove the `<section>` around `<beginning>` and `<ending>`.
