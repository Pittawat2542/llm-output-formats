The XML data provided does not contain any syntax errors, but it seems like you want to remove the `[INST] <<SYS>>` and `[/INST]` tags that are present in each example. Here's the fixed version without those:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>the ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```

If you need to present these examples in a structured way without the tags, consider using a list or multiple code blocks. Let me know if there's anything else I can help with!
