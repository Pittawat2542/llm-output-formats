The provided XML data is missing a closing `>` for the root element `<game>`. Here's the corrected version:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>the ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```
