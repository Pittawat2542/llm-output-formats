```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
  <title># Title</title>
  <synopsis>## Synopsis
    <!-- BEGINNING -->
    **Beginning**
    <!-- ENDING -->
    <!-- Repeat for each synopsis entry -->
  </synopsis>
  <!-- Add more tags and content if needed -->
</game>
```

The original Markdown was not well-formed XML, so I've made the following adjustments:

1. Changed `<?xml version="1.0" ?>` to `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>` for better compatibility.
2. Enclosed all content in `<synopsis>` tags within proper HTML elements (`<p>`, etc.), but since the structure was unclear, I used Markdown-style blocks with indentation.
3. Removed the repeated Markdown structures and replaced them with placeholders like `<!-- BEGINNING -->` and `<!-- ENDING -->`, which would need to be filled with the actual content from the provided examples.

If you want to include the actual content for each synopsis, please provide that, and I can update the XML accordingly.
