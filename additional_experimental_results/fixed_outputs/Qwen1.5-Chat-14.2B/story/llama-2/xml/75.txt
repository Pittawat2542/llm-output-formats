The XML data is already correct and well-formed. Here's the fixed version:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis>game story synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>the ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```

The issue you mentioned was with "incorrect_syntax: not well-formed (invalid token)", but since there were no syntax errors, I've returned the XML as is.
