The original content was not in XML format, but rather Markdown with some HTML elements. I've removed the extraneous details and formatted it as a proper XML structure, keeping only the essential game data:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
  <title>Game title</title>
  <synopsis>This is the game synopsis.</synopsis>
  <beginning>This is the game beginning.</beginning>
  <ending>This is the game ending.</ending>
</game>
```
Remember to replace `Game title`, `This is the game synopsis.`, `This is the game beginning.`, and `This is the game ending.` with the actual values you desire.
