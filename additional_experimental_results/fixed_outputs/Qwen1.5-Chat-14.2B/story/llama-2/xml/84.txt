The provided XML data was not well-formed due to the missing closing tag for the `<synopsis>` element. I have fixed it by adding a `/` after `Synopsis`. Here's the corrected XML:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<game>
	<title>Title</title>
	<synopsis>Synopsis/</synopsis> <!-- Added slash to close <synopsis> -->
	<beginning>Beginning</beginning>
	<ending>Ending</ending>
</game>
```

If you wanted to include images or other elements as specified in the original message, please provide new values for them. If not, this is the corrected XML format.
