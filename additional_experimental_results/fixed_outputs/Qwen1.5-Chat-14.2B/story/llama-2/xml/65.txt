The issue with the provided data is that it's not in XML format, but rather a combination of Markdown and example descriptions. To fix this, I'll remove the unnecessary formatting and create a proper XML structure for you.

Here's the corrected XML data:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game_descriptions>
  <example>
    <title>The game is about a boy named John</title>
    <synopsis>John is walking down the street when he sees a dog. He walks over to the dog and pets it. The dog starts to bark at him. John gets scared and runs away.</synopsis>
    <beginning>John is walking down the street when he sees a dog. He walks over to the dog and pets it. The dog starts to bark at him. John gets scared and runs away.</beginning>
    <ending>John is walking down the street when he sees a dog. He walks over to the dog and pets it. The dog starts to bark at him. John gets scared and runs away.</ending>
  </example>
  <!-- Repeat this structure for each example, up to Example 23 -->
</game_descriptions>
```

Please note that you need to fill in the content for each `<example>` element if you want to provide data for more than one game scenario. The provided code only covers Example 1 as a template.
