The provided original content was not well-formed XML due to the missing `encoding` attribute in the XML declaration. I've added the `encoding="UTF-8"` attribute and structured the content as a `<game_library>` containing a list of `<example>` elements, each representing a separate example. You can fill in the values for Titles, Synopses, Beginnings, and Endings for Examples 2 to 61 as needed.
