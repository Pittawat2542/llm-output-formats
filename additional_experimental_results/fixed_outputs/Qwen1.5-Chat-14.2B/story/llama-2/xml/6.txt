Here is the corrected XML data:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<title>Game Title</title>
	<synopsis>Game Story Synopsis</synopsis>
	<beginning>The Beginning of the Game</beginning>
	<ending>The Ending of the Game</ending>
</game>
```

The changes made include:

1. Added an attribute `encoding="UTF-8"` to the XML declaration for better compatibility.
2. Corrected the indentation and removed extra spaces in tags.
3. Changed "game title" to "Game Title" and "the beginning of the game" to "The Beginning of the Game" to provide more meaningful values (capitalization is usually appropriate for titles).
