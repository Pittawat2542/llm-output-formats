```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
	<title>game title</title>
	<synopsis><![CDATA[game story synopsis]]></synopsis>
	<beginning>the beginning of the game</beginning>
	<ending>the ending of the game</ending>
</game>
```
The original data had incorrect syntax due to unmatched tags and a missing attribute in the `<synopsis>` element. I have fixed it by adding a `<![CDATA[ ]]>` section to enclose theSynopsis content, which ensures proper XML formatting.
