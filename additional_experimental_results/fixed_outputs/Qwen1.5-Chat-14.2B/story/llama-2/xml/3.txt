The original data seems to have a mix of Markdown and XML formats. Here's the corrected XML version with only the required fields:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
  <title>The Game</title>
  <synopsis>The game is about a cat named Fluffy who is trying to find his owner. He is on a journey to find his owner, and he is going to be on an adventure to find him.</synopsis>
  <beginning>Fluffy wakes up and realizes that he is lost. He is in a strange place and doesn't know where he is. He starts to wonder if he is lost or if he is just in a dream.</beginning>
  <ending>Fluffy finds his owner and they are reunited. They are both happy and Fluffy is finally home.</ending>
</game>
```

I removed the duplicate `description` elements, as it's not clear how many should be present (the original had multiple). If you need to include a single optional description, you can do so like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game>
  <title>The Game</title>
  <synopsis>The game is about a cat named Fluffy who is trying to find his owner. He is on a journey to find his owner, and he is going to be on an adventure to find him.</synopsis>
  <beginning>Fluffy wakes up and realizes that he is lost. He is in a strange place and doesn't know where he is. He starts to wonder if he is lost or if he is just in a dream.</beginning>
  <ending>Fluffy finds his owner and they are reunited. They are both happy and Fluffy is finally home.</ending>
  <description>This is an optional description about the game.</description>
</game>
```
