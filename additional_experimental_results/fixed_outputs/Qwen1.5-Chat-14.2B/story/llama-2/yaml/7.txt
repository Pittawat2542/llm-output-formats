The provided YAML data is already correct. There were no syntax errors in the original input. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  beginning: "the beginning of the game"
  ending: "the ending of the game"
  synopsis: "game story synopsis"
  title: "game title"
```
If you want to include the test cases as well, they can be separated into a separate file or kept together. Here's how you can structure them:

```yaml
tests:
  game:
    - name: Run tests
      command: yarn test

    - name: Run tests in watch mode
      command: yarn test:watch

    - name: Run tests in coverage mode
      command: yarn test:coverage

    - name: Run tests in coverage mode with watch mode
      command: yarn test:coverage:watch

    # ... and so on for the rest of the test cases
```
