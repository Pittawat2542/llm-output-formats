The issue with the provided YAML data is a stray backtick (`) character at the end. It should be removed from the last line to maintain proper syntax. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  beginning: the beginning of the game
  ending: the ending of the game
  synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: game title
```

The code block containing the fixed YAML is as follows:

```yaml
game:
  beginning: the beginning of the game
  ending: the ending of the game
  synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: game title
```
