The YAML syntax was correct in all the provided examples. Here's the code block with the corrected format, if there were no issues:

```yaml
game:
  beginning: "the beginning of the game"
  ending: "the ending of the game"
  synopsis: "game story synopsis"
  title: "game title"
```

If you need to apply this structure to any other values, just replace the string content inside the quotes with the appropriate data.
