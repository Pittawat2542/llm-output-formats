The provided YAML data is already correct. There were no syntax errors in the given examples, and it matches the expected output format. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  beginning: the beginning of the game
  ending: the ending of the game
  synopsis: "A story about a man and a woman."
  title: "The Last of Us"
```

If you intended to have multiple answers for the same question, it would look like this:

```yaml
game:
  questions:
    - question: What is the title of the game?
      answer: The title of the game is The Last of Us.

    - question: What is the synopsis of the game?
      answer: A story about a man and a woman.
```

But based on your examples, it seems you only need one `synopsis` key.
