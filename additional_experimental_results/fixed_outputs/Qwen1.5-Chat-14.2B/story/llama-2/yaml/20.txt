The YAML data provided does not contain any syntax errors. Each example is correct as it stands. Here's the code block with the valid YAML:

```yaml
game:
  beginning: the beginning of the game
  ending: the ending of the game
  synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: game title
```

If you want to create multiple instances of this structure, each with a unique identifier or index, you can modify it like this:

```yaml
- id: example_1
  game:
    beginning: the beginning of the game
    ending: the ending of the game
    synopsis: game story synopsis
    title: game title

- id: example_2
  game:
    beginning: the beginning of another game
    ending: the ending of another game
    synopsis: different game story synopsis
    title: another game title
```

And so on, for as many examples as needed, replacing `example_1`, `example_2`, etc., with appropriate identifiers.
