The provided YAML data seems to be correct and doesn't have any syntax issues. Here's the fixed version:

```yaml
game:
  beginning: the beginning of the game
  ending: the ending of the game
  synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: game title
```

There were no errors mentioned, so this is the YAML in a code block.
