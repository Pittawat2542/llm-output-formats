The issue with the provided YAML data is that there's a stray backtick (`) character at the start of the document, which isn't part of any valid YAML syntax. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  beginning: "the beginning of the game"
  ending: "the ending of the game"
  synopsis: "game story synopsis"
  title: "game title"
```

All instances where there might be a stray backtick have been removed, and the values are enclosed in double quotes to handle string literals correctly.
