The original YAML data is correct and does not contain any syntax errors. Here it is in a code block:

```yaml
game:
  beginning: the beginning of the game
  ending: the ending of the game
  synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: game title
```

If there were supposed to be additional examples, they should also follow the same correct syntax.
