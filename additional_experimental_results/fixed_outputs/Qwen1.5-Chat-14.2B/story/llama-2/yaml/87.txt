The issue with the provided YAML is that it uses backticks (`) instead of double quotes (") for string values. In YAML, strings are enclosed in double quotes. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  title: "The Last of Us"
  synopsis: "A post-apocalyptic tale set in the wake of a zombie apocalypse."
  beginning: "In a post-apocalyptic world, a man and his daughter try to survive in a world overrun by zombies."
  ending: "The man and his daughter survive the zombie apocalypse and start a new life together."
```
The code block containing the fixed YAML is:
```yaml
game:
  title: "The Last of Us"
  synopsis: "A post-apocalyptic tale set in the wake of a zombie apocalypse."
  beginning: "In a post-apocalyptic world, a man and his daughter try to survive in a world overrun by zombies."
  ending: "The man and his daughter survive the zombie apocalypse and start a new life together."
```
