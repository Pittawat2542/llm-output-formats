The provided YAML data is correct and doesn't need any changes. Here's the fixed version:

```yaml
game:
  beginning: the beginning of the game
  ending: the ending of the game
  synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: game title
```

If you intended to include examples with different values or repeat the same data, please provide the new values. Otherwise, this is the correct YAML format for a single `game` entry.
