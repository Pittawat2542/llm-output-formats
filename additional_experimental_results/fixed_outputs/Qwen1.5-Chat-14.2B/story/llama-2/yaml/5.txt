All examples provided are correct YAML syntax, so there's no need to fix them. Here they are in a code block with proper indentation:

```yaml
game:
  beginning: the beginning of the game
  ending: the ending of the game
  synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: game title
```

Each example is identical and represents a valid YAML object for a "game" structure.
