All examples provided are correct YAML syntax, with no errors. Here's the same YAML data in a code block:

```yaml
game:
  beginning: "the beginning of the game"
  ending: "the ending of the game"
  synopsis: "game story synopsis"
  title: "game title"
```

Each example is identical to the others, with no need for separate code blocks since they all have the same structure. If you intended to provide a list or array of these objects, please specify, as YAML can handle multiple entries under the same key.
