The original message was not actually incorrect YAML data, as it does not follow a standard YAML format with key-value pairs. However, if you want to represent this information in a more structured YAML block, you can do so like this:

```yaml
game_description:
  - starting_point: the beginning of the game
  - ending_point: the ending of the game
  story_synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: game title
```

This way, you have encapsulated the information in a single "game_description" object with list items for clarity. If you prefer to maintain the original format without any changes, it would still be valid as provided. Here's the unchanged code block:

```yaml
<</SYS>>
The beginning of the game is the start of the story. The ending of the game is the end of the story. The synopsis is the story of the game. The title is the name of the game.
```
