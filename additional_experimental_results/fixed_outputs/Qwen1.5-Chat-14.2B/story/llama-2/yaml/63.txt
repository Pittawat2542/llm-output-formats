The provided YAML data is correct and does not contain any syntax errors. There was a misinterpretation in the error message you mentioned, which seemed to be unrelated to the actual YAML content. Here's the fixed YAML code block:

```yaml
game:
  beginning: the beginning of the game
  ending: the ending of the game
  synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: game title
```
