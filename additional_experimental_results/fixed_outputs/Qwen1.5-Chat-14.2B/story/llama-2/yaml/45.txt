The provided YAML data does not contain any syntax errors. Here's the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  beginning: "the beginning of the game"
  ending: "the ending of the game"
  synopsis: "game story synopsis"
  title: "game title"
```
If you want to modify any values, please provide the new ones, and I'll update accordingly.
