The YAML data provided is already correct and doesn't need any changes. Here's the correctly formatted YAML:

```yaml
game:
  beginning: "the beginning of the game"
  ending: "the ending of the game"
  synopsis: "game story synopsis"
  title: "game title"
```

Note that I replaced single quotes (`'`) with double quotes (`"`) around the strings to avoid any potential issues with YAML syntax.
