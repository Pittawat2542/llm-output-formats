The original YAML data is correct and does not have any syntax errors. Here's the corrected YAML code block:

```yaml
game:
  beginning: "the beginning of the game"
  ending: "the ending of the game"
  synopsis: "game story synopsis"
  title: "game title"
```

I added double quotes around the string values to resolve any potential issues with single quotes.
