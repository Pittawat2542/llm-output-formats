```yaml
game:
  beginning: "the beginning of the game"
  ending: "the ending of the game"
  synopsis: "game story synopsis"
  title: "game title"
```

The issue was with single quotes (`'`) used around some string values. YAML requires double quotes (`"`) for string literals. I have replaced them with double quotes in the corrected version.
