The provided YAML data is already correct and has no syntax errors. Here's the fixed YAML in a code block:

```yaml
game:
  beginning: "the beginning of the game"
  ending: "the ending of the game"
  synopsis: "game story synopsis"
  title: "game title"
```

All single quotes have been replaced with double quotes, which is the correct syntax for string values in YAML.
