```yaml
game:
  beginning: "the beginning of the game"
  ending: "the ending of the game"
  synopsis: "game story synopsis"
  title: "game title"
```
The issue was that single quotes (`'`) were used instead of double quotes (`"`), which is the correct syntax for string values in YAML. I've replaced the single quotes with double quotes to fix it.
