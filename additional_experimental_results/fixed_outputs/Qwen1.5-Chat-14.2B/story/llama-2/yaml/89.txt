```yaml
game:
  beginning: "the beginning of the game"
  ending: "the ending of the game"
  synopsis: "game story synopsis"
  title: "game title"
```

All examples provided had correct YAML syntax, but I replaced some incorrect characters (`'` instead of `"` for string values) and added double quotes to the string fields as required in YAML. If you intended to use single quotes around the strings, please let me know.
