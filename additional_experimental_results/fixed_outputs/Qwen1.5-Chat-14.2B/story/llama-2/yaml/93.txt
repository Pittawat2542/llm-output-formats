The original message was not a valid YAML document, as it contained an illegal character (`</SYS>>`). To fix this, we can remove any non-YAML characters. Here is the corrected YAML:

```yaml
game:
  beginning: the beginning of the game
  ending: the ending of the game
  synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: game title
```
The code block containing the fixed YAML data is as follows:

```yaml
game:
  beginning: the beginning of the game
  ending: the ending of the game
  synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: game title
```
