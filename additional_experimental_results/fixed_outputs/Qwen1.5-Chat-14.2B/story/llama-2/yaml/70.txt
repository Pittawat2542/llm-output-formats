The original YAML data is correct and doesn't require any changes. Here's the correctly formatted YAML:

```yaml
game:
  beginning: "the beginning of the game"
  ending: "the ending of the game"
  synopsis: "game story synopsis"
  title: "game title"
```

There was a stray backtick (`) at the start of the file, which caused the reported error. I have removed it to make the YAML valid.
