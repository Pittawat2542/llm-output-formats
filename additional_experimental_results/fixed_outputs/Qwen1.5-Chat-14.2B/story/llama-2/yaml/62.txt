The provided YAML data is already correct and does not contain any syntax errors. Here it is in a code block:

```yaml
game:
  beginning: the beginning of the game
  ending: the ending of the game
  synopsis: game story synopsis
  title: game title
```

All the examples given are identical to this one, and there's no need for repetition since they're all correct. If you intended to provide a list of YAML examples with different values, please let me know, and I'll adjust accordingly.
