```yaml
game:
  beginning: 
    # the beginning of the game
    character:
      # the protagonist, or the character whose actions drive the plot
      title: the game title
      # what happened

  ending: 
    # the ending of the game
    character:
      # the protagonist, or the character whose actions drive the plot
      title: (insert ending title here)
      # what happened
  synopsis: 
    # game story synopsis
    character:
      # the protagonist, or the character whose actions drive the plot
      title: (synopsis character title here)
      # what happened
```
In this fixed YAML, I added missing keys `title` for both the beginning and ending `character`, removed unnecessary comments, and left placeholders for the values that should be provided.
