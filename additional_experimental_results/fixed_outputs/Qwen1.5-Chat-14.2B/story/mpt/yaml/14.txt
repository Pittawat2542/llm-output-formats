  beginning: "As the credits rolled and the audience cheered, the game designer watched on anxiously from the corner of the room. He knew that his creation had been a hit, but he also knew it wasn't perfect. The controls felt a little too tight, and the story, while original, left much to be desired. Still, it was enough to launch his company into the big leagues, and he couldn't be happier."
  ending: "The game designer walked up to the mic and took a deep breath. He smiled and nodded at the crowd. They'd been pretty tough on him all day long, and he was happy to finally have their approval. 'Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce the next big game by my company. It's called 'The Great Escape.'"
  synopsis: "The game is an adventure where you play as an unfortunate prisoner attempting to escape a maximum-security prison, with a daunting obstacle being the warden's best guard at the gates."
  title: "The Great Escape"
  multiplayer_game_party: "After his initial playtest, he decided to host a party for people to play through the game together. It was the perfect way to get feedback and bond with the gaming community."
