  beginning: |
    The world suddenly shifted to different dimensions and space-time!
    Fantasy creatures and heroes from legends sprung to life and fought!
  synopsis: >
    King Bard and his royal guards were ambushed by orc bands of all sorts.
    Heavy fighting ensued, and many of his guards and servants lost their lives
    to the numerous orc warriors. He and his few remaining guards retreated into
    the castle as they couldn't fight against the overwhelming numbers. The
    remaining nobles surrendered the castle to the Orcs, losing hope for their survival.
   的关键在于缩进错误和在多行字符串中使用了不恰当的换行，我已修正。现在synopsis字段使用了`> ...`来表示多行文本。

  ending:
    - The king and his band of loyal servants and fighters could no longer fend for themselves!
      To make matters worse, the king lost his right arm. Their only hope was the castle dungeon's treasure.
      King Bard summoned his bravest warriors to retrieve the key from the orcs. 
      ...
      ...
      In the final chamber, the king and remaining warriors fought valiantly, eventually driving the orcs away.
      They returned to find their world in ruins, but with determination, they vowed to rebuild and protect it.
