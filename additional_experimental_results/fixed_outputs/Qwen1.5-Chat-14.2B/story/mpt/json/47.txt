As they discover more of the map, they gain access to more areas and resources. They can use these resources to craft weapons and armor that they can use throughout the game. In the second chapter, the player learns that the game's antagonist is coming for them, and they must set up a massive trap to take them out. One of the best parts is the extensive character customization options: you can change your character's appearance, personality, and skill usage. The game emphasizes creating your own story, providing a truly immersive experience.",
