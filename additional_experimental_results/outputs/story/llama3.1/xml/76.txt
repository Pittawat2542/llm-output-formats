The wind howls through your hair, carrying whispers of ancient battles long past. Suddenly, a faint energy signature pulses from beneath the sands, drawing your eyes to a location marked "Eldarath's Edge."</beginning>
    <ending>With the city's powerful artifact in hand, you face off against the leader of the war-mongering nation, who seeks to harness its might for their own purposes.
