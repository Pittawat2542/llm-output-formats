She informs you that The Devourers have breached the city's walls and are heading straight for the central square. You must rush to her location and fight off hordes of creatures to save her and uncover the truth behind their origins.</beginning>
	<ending>After a long and grueling journey, you finally reach the source of The Devourers: an ancient underground temple hidden deep within the ruins of New Eden.
