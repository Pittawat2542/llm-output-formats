  synopsis: |-
    In Echoes of Eternity, players take on the role of a temporal archaeologist tasked with navigating the ruins of Eridoria and unraveling the mysteries behind its fractured timeline. As they journey through ancient civilizations and encounter beings from diverse eras, they begin to uncover hints of an ancient cataclysm that has shattered the fabric of time.

    With each new discovery, players are forced to confront their own existence and question whether their memories are true or fabricated. The choices they make will shape not only their understanding of Eridoria but also the very essence of their own identity.
