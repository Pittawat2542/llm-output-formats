  title: "The Last Hope"
  synopsis: |
    In a post-apocalyptic world, humanity is on the brink of extinction. A powerful virus has ravaged the planet, turning most of the population into zombie-like creatures known as "The Devouring". The remaining survivors are few and far between, forced to live in underground bunkers and fend for themselves.

    You play as a young survivor named Maya, who has lost her family and is searching for a cure for the virus. Along the way, she discovers that she has a rare genetic trait that makes her immune to The Devouring's effects. With this newfound power, Maya must navigate the treacherous world above ground, fighting against hordes of infected creatures and rival human factions vying for control.

    As you journey through the ruins of civilization, you'll encounter other survivors who will aid or hinder your progress. You'll uncover hidden secrets about the virus's origins and the truth behind the world's downfall. With each step forward, the fate of humanity hangs in the balance – will you be able to find a cure and save what's left of society?

  ending: |
    The game concludes with Maya discovering the location of the original outbreak source, where she finds evidence that points to an unexpected culprit behind the virus's creation. Confronting this figure, Maya must make a choice that will decide the fate of humanity:

    A) Sacrifice herself to destroy the last remnants of the virus, eradicating it from the planet but also sealing her own fate.

    B) Use her immunity to develop a cure, sharing it with the world and giving humanity a chance to rebuild – but at the risk of being seen as a liability or a potential threat by others.

    C) Join forces with a faction leader who offers to help Maya in finding a cure in exchange for her loyalty, forcing Maya to choose between saving the world and serving the greater good.

    The player's decision sets the course for the game's multiple endings.
