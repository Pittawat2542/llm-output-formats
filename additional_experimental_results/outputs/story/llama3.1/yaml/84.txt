  title: Echoes of Eternity
  synopsis: In a world where time is broken, players take on the role of a Chronomancer, tasked with unraveling the mysteries behind the timestream's collapse. As they journey through ancient ruins, abandoned cities, and otherworldly realms, they must repair the fabric of time by solving puzzles, battling distorted creatures, and making choices that shape the fate of civilizations.
  beginning: The game begins in a world where clocks have stopped ticking, and people are trapped in loops of repetition. Players discover a mysterious artifact known as the Timekeeper's Gear, which allows them to manipulate time itself.
  ending: With the timestream repaired, players must make one final choice that will determine the course of history. Will they opt for a return to a bygone era, a utopian future, or something entirely new? The fate of entire civilizations hangs in the balance as the player's decision sets the world on a new path.
