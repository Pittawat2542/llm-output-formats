  title: Echoes of Eternity
  synopsis: In a world where time is broken, fragments of eternity have shattered and scattered across dimensions. You are a Time Weaver, tasked with traversing these fragments to repair the fabric of reality.
  beginning: The game begins in the Mortlake Asylum, a mystical realm where you awaken with no memory of who you are or how you got there. A mysterious figure known only as "The Architect" reveals your destiny and sets you on a quest to find the scattered fragments of eternity.
  ending: Upon collecting all the fragments and restoring balance to time, you discover that The Architect was actually a future version of yourself from a world where time has been repaired. As a final gesture, this future self hands over a temporal artifact containing echoes from across infinite timelines, leaving you to ponder the consequences of altering reality.
