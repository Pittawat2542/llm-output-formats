  title: "Echoes of Eternity"
  synopsis: |-
    In a world where time has broken, fragments of eras past and future collide. Players take on the role of a Chronomancer, tasked with navigating through the fabric of time to prevent the catastrophic convergence of timelines.
  beginning: The game begins in a realm known as the Nexus, a hub world that serves as a crossroads for various eras. The player is introduced to their mentor, a wise Chronomancer named Aria, who gifts them with a Time-seeing crystal and sets them on a quest to stop an unknown force disrupting the timeline.
  ending: With multiple endings depending on player choices throughout the game, one possible outcome sees the Chronomancer succeed in stopping the catastrophic convergence by collecting and placing fragments of the timestream back into their original order. However, this victory comes at a great personal cost, as the act of altering history causes irreparable damage to the fabric of time itself.
