  synopsis: |-
    The game story begins in a world called Aethoria, where magic once flourished but has since disappeared. Players are tasked with guiding their apprentice through a journey of discovery and growth as they seek to revive the lost art of magic.

    Along the way, the player's hero must navigate treacherous landscapes, encounter various non-playable characters (NPCs) who can aid or hinder progress, and make difficult choices that impact the story and its outcome.

    As players explore the world, they will uncover ancient ruins containing powerful artifacts left behind by a long-lost civilization. These relics hold the key to restoring magic, but at a great cost to those who wield them.

    The player must decide how to balance power and responsibility, as their hero's journey raises questions about the true nature of magic and its impact on Aethoria's fragile ecosystem.
