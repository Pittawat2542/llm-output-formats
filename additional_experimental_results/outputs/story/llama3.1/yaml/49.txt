    In a world where time is broken, players take on the role of a Chronomancer, tasked with repairing the fabric of reality. A powerful entity known as the Time Reaver has shattered the timestream, creating temporal rifts that are unraveling the very essence of existence.

Along the way, they must confront rival Chronomancers seeking to exploit the power of broken time for their own gain.
