As they journey through ancient ruins and mysterious landscapes, they uncover clues that suggest a catastrophic event known as 'The Great Dissonance' has caused the very fabric of reality to unravel.",
    "beginning": "Players start in the city of Erebo, where rumors of an impending catastrophe have drawn them to the attention of the enigmatic Order of the Timeless. The leader of the Order, a mysterious figure known only as 'The Chronokeeper', tasks the player with retrieving three ancient artifacts hidden across different eras of history.",
    "ending": "Upon collecting all three artifacts, players must return to Erebo and use their combined power to restore balance to the timestream. However, they soon discover that The Great Dissonance was not a natural event, but rather the result of an ancient civilization's attempt to harness time itself. To prevent a new catastrophe, players must confront the dark forces behind this catastrophe and make a choice: allow the timeline to continue on its current path, or alter it forever, risking unforeseen consequences."
