  title: Echoes of Eternity
  beginning: In a world where time is broken, the land of Aethoria lies shattered. The fabric of reality has been torn asunder by a cataclysmic event known as "The Great Dissonance", causing temporal echoes to reverberate across the realm.
  ending: As the protagonist, a gifted Timekeeper, unravels the mysteries behind the Great Dissonance and restores the balance of time, Aethoria begins to heal. However, this newfound equilibrium comes at a cost: the memories of those who existed before the cataclysm begin to fade into oblivion.
  synopsis:
    In Echoes of Eternity, players take on the role of a Timekeeper tasked with repairing the fractured timeline. Guided by a cryptic entity known as "The Architect", they must navigate through labyrinthine landscapes and confront powerful entities born from the echoes of time.

    As they progress through their quest, the protagonist uncovers a complex web of events and conspiracies that led to the Great Dissonance. With each fragment of the timeline restored, the Timekeeper inches closer to uncovering the truth behind their own existence and the true purpose of The Architect.

    Will the protagonist be able to restore Aethoria's temporal balance without losing themselves in the process, or will they succumb to the echoes of eternity?
