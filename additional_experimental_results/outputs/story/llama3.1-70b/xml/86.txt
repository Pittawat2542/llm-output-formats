	<title>Echoes of Eternity</title>
	<synopsis>In a world where time has no meaning, the fabric of reality is threatened by a mysterious force known as "The Devourer". Players take on the role of an ancient being tasked with traversing the labyrinthine paths of the timestream to prevent the destruction of entire civilizations. As the last hope for the multiverse, they must confront their own memories and the echoes of eternity to save existence itself.</synopsis>
	<beginning>The game begins in a desolate, timeless realm known as the "Nexus", where the player's character is awakened by a cryptic entity known only as "The Architect". With no memory of their past, they are tasked with exploring the Nexus and uncovering the secrets of their existence. As they progress, they discover fragments of their memories and the truth about the world they inhabit.</beginning>
	<ending>The final confrontation takes place at the heart of The Devourer's stronghold, where the player must face their own darkness and make a choice that will determine the fate of eternity. Depending on the player's actions throughout the game, there are multiple endings: one where the player succeeds in defeating The Devourer and restoring balance to the timestream; another where they succumb to their own darkness and become the very evil they sought to defeat; and a third where they choose to transcend their existence and become one with the cosmos.</ending>
