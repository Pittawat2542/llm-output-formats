        <background>Formerly a skilled member of an elite N'Korian special forces unit, Evie was gravely injured in a mission gone wrong. She was left for dead on the planet Xylophia-IV, where she was discovered by a group of scavengers and taken in. The scavengers, who were also N'Korians, took it upon themselves to enhance Evie with advanced cybernetic implants, granting her new life but also changing her beyond recognition.</background>
