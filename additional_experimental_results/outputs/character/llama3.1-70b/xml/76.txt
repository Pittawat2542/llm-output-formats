        <background>Eira was born to a human father and an elven mother in a small village on the outskirts of a kingdom. She was trained in the art of stealth and deception from a young age by her mother, who was a skilled ranger. Eira's life took a dramatic turn when her village was attacked by bandits, and she was forced to flee. She has been on the run ever since, using her skills to survive and seeking revenge against those who destroyed her home.</background>
