    <background>Eira was born to a human father and an elven mother in a small village on the edge of a vast forest. She was trained by her parents in the art of stealth and deception, and quickly became skilled in the ways of the rogue. As she grew older, Eira became increasingly restless, feeling confined by the limitations of her village life. She set out into the wider world, seeking adventure and fortune.</background>
