		<background>Eira was born to a human father and elven mother in a small village on the outskirts of a kingdom. She showed exceptional agility and stealth skills from a young age, which her parents nurtured by training her in the art of hunting. As she grew older, Eira became increasingly restless, feeling confined by the limitations of her rural life. She set out into the world to seek adventure and fortune, quickly falling into a life of thievery and assassination.</background>
