Here is a Python function that generates an enemy battle status and returns it in YAML format:

```python
import yaml
import random

def generate_enemy_status():
    enemy_names = ["Goblin", "Troll", "Dragon", "Wraith", "Skeleton"]
    enemy_descriptions = [
        "A small, pesky creature with a fondness for trouble.",
        "A hulking beast with incredible strength and aggression.",
        "A fearsome flying creature with scales as black as coal.",
        "An undead spirit bound to the mortal realm by unfinished business.",
        "A reanimated corpse driven solely by a hunger for flesh."
    ]

    enemy_name = random.choice(enemy_names)
    enemy_description = random.choice(enemy_descriptions)

    enemy_atk = random.randint(5, 20)
    enemy_def = random.randint(3, 15)
    enemy_hp = random.randint(10, 50)
    enemy_mp = random.randint(0, 20)
    enemy_spd = random.randint(5, 20)

    enemy_status = {
        "game": {
            "enemy": {
                "description": enemy_description,
                "id": "E001",
                "name": enemy_name,
                "stats": {
                    "atk": enemy_atk,
                    "def": enemy_def,
                    "hp": enemy_hp,
                    "mp": enemy_mp,
                    "spd": enemy_spd
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return yaml.dump(enemy_status, default_flow_style=False)

# Example usage:
print(generate_enemy_status())
```

You can copy the output into a Markdown code block:

```yaml
game:
  enemy:
    description: A small, pesky creature with a fondness for trouble.
    id: E001
    name: Goblin
    stats:
      atk: 14
      def: 8
      hp: 31
      mp: 5
      spd: 18
```
