```json
{
    "game": {
        "enemy": {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "Slime",
            "description": "A weak, low-level enemy with a tendency to drop slime pellets.",
            "stats": {
                "hp": 100,
                "mp": 20,
                "atk": 10,
                "def": 5,
                "spd": 15
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Note: The above output is just an example of what the JSON format could look like. In a real game, you would likely have many more enemies with different stats and descriptions.
