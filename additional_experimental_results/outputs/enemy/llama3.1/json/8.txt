            "id": "E001",
            "name": "Goblin King",
            "description": "The leader of the goblin tribe. He's fierce and won't back down from a fight.",
            "stats": {
                "hp": 120,
                "mp": 20,

    }
}
```

Note: You can easily generate new enemies by modifying the JSON object with different stats and descriptions. The `id` field is used to uniquely identify each enemy, while the other fields provide additional information about the enemy's characteristics and behavior.
